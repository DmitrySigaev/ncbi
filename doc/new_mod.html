	 <h1>Starting new C++ module(source and headers)</h1>


	 Usually, each C++ module consists of 3 files:
    <ul>
      <li>
		<a href="framewrk.hpp">Header file(*.hpp)</a> --
		API for the external users.  Ideally, this file contains only
		declarations of things(with good comments) that are to be used
		by external users. No less, and no more.
		<li>
		<a href="framewrk.inl">Inline file(*.inl)</a> --
		All inline function definitions go here, along with the declarations
		of internally(or indirectly) used things that are of no interest
		the external user but still must be included as a part of the
		header file(see <a href="framewrk.hpp">example </a>).
      <li>
		<a href="framewrk.cpp">Source file(*.cpp)</a> --
		Definitions of non-inline functions and internally used things that
		should not be included to other modules.
    </ul>

    Each and every source file must include NCBI disclamer and (preferably)
    CVS info. Then, the header file must be protected from double-include,
	 and it must include <i>"*.inl"</i> file, if any.
	 <p>
	 The above examples contain a standard startup frameworks so
	 that one could just cut&amp;paste one of them to start a new C++ file
	 (just dont forget to replace the <i>"framewrk"</i> stubs by your new module
	 name).
