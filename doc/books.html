All new changes are being made to the Toolkit Book
at the following locations:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Official Release:</i> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">
    C++ Toolkit Book</a>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Development Version:</i> <a href="http://xpubmed0.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:5701/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">

    C++ Toolkit Book (no search engine, accessible from inside NCBI only)</a>. </li> </ul> The Development Version is the most recent documentation before it becomes an Official Release. While the Development Version is the lastest version, it is accessible only from inside NCBI, and the search engine functionality is currently missing. Also, the location of the Development Version may change without warning! So it is suggested that you use the Official Release, and use the Development Version only when necessary.</p> </i>

<h2>Books</h2>

<li><p>
<i>On To C++,  by Patrick Henry Winston</i><br><br>
If you are looking for a short and concise tutorial, this is as close
as you can get. It doesn't cover all of C++, but many of the essential
features (except the STL). A decent first book to buy. </p>

<li><p>
<i>The C++ Primer, Third Edition</i>,
by Stanley Lippman and Josee Lajoie <br><br>
A decent book, much expanded from previous editions.
Gets carried away with very long examples, which makes it harder
to use as a reference.
Full coverage of ANSI/ISO C++. </p>

<li><p>
<i>The C++ Programming Language, Third Edition</i>
by Bjarne Stroustrup <br><br>
Often called the best book for C++ written in Danish.
Written by the designer  of C++, this is a difficult read unless you
already know C++.
Full coverage  of ANSI/ISO C++. </p>

<li><p>
<i>Effective C++, Second Edition: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs</i>,
by Scott Meyers. <br><br>
A must-have that describes lots of tips, tricks, and pitfalls of C++
programming. </p>

<li><p>
<i>More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs</i>,
by Scott Meyers.<br><br>
Same as above. For example, how is the new operator different from
operator new? Operator new is called by the new operator to allocate
memory for the object being created.
This is how you hook your own malloc into C++. </p>
