All new changes are being made to the Toolkit Book
at the following locations:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Official Release:</i> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">
    C++ Toolkit Book</a>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Development Version:</i> <a href="http://xpubmed0.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:5701/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">

    C++ Toolkit Book (no search engine, accessible from inside NCBI only)</a>. </li> </ul> The Development Version is the most recent documentation before it becomes an Official Release. While the Development Version is the lastest version, it is accessible only from inside NCBI, and the search engine functionality is currently missing. Also, the location of the Development Version may change without warning! So it is suggested that you use the Official Release, and use the Development Version only when necessary.</p> </i>

<a name="ref_MacProjTree"></a><h2>Building with Metrowerks CodeWarrior (Version 
8.0 Update 8.3)</h2>

<p>We now build all the libraries and most of the applications including the 
Genome Workbench (gbench). We do not build any of the many test or demo apps 
(except testvalidator). We also build the fltk library's GUI editor, fluid.</p>
<p>All apps are built as application bundles except gbench_plugin_scan and 
datatool which are built as command line apps. Any of the applications can be 
built as command line apps by tweaking the build scripts or the Codewarrior 
projects.</p>
<p>Build procedure is still the same: use an AppleScript editor to open and run 
the script files makeLibs.met and makeApps.met. You must use a script editor 
capable of opening a script file larger than 32K, such as Apple's Script Editor 
v2.0, or Smile. Script Editor v1.9 will not work since makeLibs.met just got too 
big. The command line tool osascript also works.</p>
<p>Projects include targets to compile with BSD/Apple headers and libraries and 
with MSL headers and libraries, but plugins (for gbench) built with MSL do not 
link properly, and so, beause of lack of interest to keep up with changes, some 
source code does not currently compile with MSL. Hopefully this will become 
easier to work with and get fixed with Codewarrior v.9.</p>
<p>Targets to be compiled can be controlled by including an empty file or folder 
in the compilers:mac_prj folder with the name 'Build' followed by the keywords 
of the targets you want built. The keywords are: MSL, BSD, Debug and Final. For 
example, to build only the BSD Debug targets use: &quot;Build BSD Debug&quot;, to build 
both BSD debug and release (final) versions: &quot;Build BSD&quot;. The default is to 
build everything.</p>
<p>If you install the C++ toolkit under a different name than &quot;ncbi_cxx&quot; or in a 
different location than your home directory, you can edit the script's 
properties, pRootFolderName and pRootFolderPath, to override these defaults. 
Note: these paths, and those mentioned below, must be entered in mac format 
(e.g. disk:Users:username:) not Unix format (e.g. /Users/username/). The disk 
name (and its following colon) may be omitted.</p>
<p>Certain third party libraries are required to build the C++ toolkit. The 
scripts will try and find them if they are in your home directory, or you can 
specify where they were installed using properties at the beginning of the 
script:</p>

<p>The latest release of fltk, 1.1.4x should be used. </p>
<p>You do not have to build the fltk or bdb libraries separately. This is done 
by the scripts and Codewarrior along with the toolkit libraries. Just unpack the 
the source bundles in your home directory or where ever you have specified in 
the appropriate properties. The root folders for fltk and bdb do not have to 
have any particular names. If there is more than one version the scripts will 
grab whichever is last alphabetically (e.g. fltk-1.1.4r2 will get used instead 
of fltk-1.1.3). </p>
<p>The scripts normally halt on any Codewarrior compilation errors. If you want 
them to continue and save errors, set the next script property, 
pSaveContinueOnErrors, to true. Compilation errors for a project will be saved 
in a file in the same folder as the project being built, with a name in the 
following format: projectName-targetNumber.errs (e.g. xncbi-2.errs).</p>
<p>The Genome Workbench's configuration file(s) is stored in the users 
Library:Application Support:gbench folder.</p>
<p>CFM builds are not supported. OS 8 or 9 are not supported. We know 10.2 
works. We think 10.1 still works.</p>
