<h3>
Introduction</h3>
Run-time information about data types is necessary in several contexts,
including:
<ol>
<li>
When reading, writing, and processing serialized data, where runtime information
about a type's internal structure is needed</li>

<li>
When reading from an arbitrary data source, where data members' external
aliases must be used to locate the corresponding class data members (e.g.
<i>MyXxx</i>
may be aliased as <i>my-xxx</i> in the input data file)</li>

<li>
When using a generalized <i><a href="iterators.html">C++ type iterator</a></i>
to traverse the data members of an object</li>

<li>
When accessing the object type information <i>per se </i>(without regard
to any particular object instance), e.g. to dump it to a file as ASN.1
or DTD <i>specifications</i> (not <i>data</i>)</li>
</ol>
In the first three cases above, it is necessary to have both the object
itself <i>as well as</i> its runtime type information.&nbsp; This is because
in these contexts, the object is usually passed inside a generic function,
as a pointer to its most base parent type <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/CPP_DOC/docxx/CObject.html">CObject.</a>
The runtime type information is needed here, as there is no other way to
ascertain the actual object's data members. In addition to providing this
information, a runtime type information object provides an interface for
accessing and modifying these data members.
<p>In the last case (4) above, the type information is used independent
of any actual object instances.
<p>The NCBI C++ Toolkit uses two classes to support these requirements:
<ul><a NAME="ctypeinfo"></a>
<li>
<b><i>Type</i> information classes</b> (base class <i><a href="../docxx/CTypeInfo.html">CTypeInfo</a></i>)
are intended for internal usage only, and they encode information about
a type, devoid of any instances of that type. This information includes
the class layout, inheritance relations, external alias, and various other
attributes such as size, which are independent of specific <i>instances</i>.
Each data member of a class also has its own type information. Thus, in
addition to providing information relevant to the member's occurrence in
the class (e.g. the member name and offset), the type information for a
<i>class</i>
must also provide access to the type information for each of its
<i>members</i>.</li>

<br>Limited type information is also available for types other than classes,
such as primitive data types, enumerations, containers, and pointers. For
example, the type information for a primitive type specifies that it is
an <i>int, float,</i> or <i>char</i>, etc., and whether or not that element
is signed. Enumerations are a special kind of primitive type, whose type
information specifies its enumeration values and named elements. Type information
for containers specifies both the type of container and the type of elements
that it holds.
<p><a NAME="ref_ObjectInfo"></a>
<li>
<a href="#cobjinfo"><i>Object</i> information classes</a> (base class <i><a href="../docxx/CObjectTypeInfo.html">CObjectTypeInfo</a></i>)
include a pointer to the type information as well as a pointer to the object
<i>instance</i>,
and provide a safe interface to that object. In situations where type information
is used independent of any concrete object, the <i>object</i> information
class simply serves as a wrapper to a <i>type</i> information object. Where
access to an object instance <i>is</i> required, the object pointer provides
direct access to the correctly type-cast instance, and the interface provides
methods to access and/or modify the object itself or members of that object.</li>
</ul>
The C++ Toolkit stores the type information outside any instances of that
type, in a statically created <i>CTypeInfo</i> object. For <i>class</i>
objects, this <i>CTypeInfo</i> object can be accessed by all <i>instances</i>
of the class via a static <i><a href="../lxr/ident?i=GetTypeInfo">GetTypeInfo()</a></i>
class method. Similarly, for primitive types and other constructs that
have no way of associating methods with them <i>per se</i>, a static globally
defined <i>GetTypeInfoXxx()</i> function is used to access a static <i>CTypeInfo</i>
object. (The <i>Xxx</i> suffix is used here to indicate that a globally
unique name is generated for the function).
<p>All of the automatically generated classes and constructs defined in
the C++ Toolkit's
<b><i><a href="../lxr/source/include/objects/">objects/</a></i></b>directory
already have static <i>GetTypeInfo()</i> functions implemented for them.
In order to make type information about
<i>user-defined</i> classes and
elements also accessible, you will need to implement static <i>GetTypeInfo()</i>
functions for these constructs. A number of pre-processor macros are available
to support this activity, and are described in the section on <i><a href="usrtypeinfo.html">User-defined
Type Information</a></i>.
<p>Type information is often needed when the object itself has been passed
anonymously, or as a pointer to its parent class. In this case, it is not
possible to invoke the <i>GetTypeInfo()</i> method directly, as the object's
exact type is unknown. Using a <i>&lt;static_cast></i> operator to enable
the member function is also unsafe, as it may open the door to incorrectly
associating an object's pointer with the wrong type information. For these
reasons, the <i>CTypeInfo</i> class is intended for internal usage only,
and it is the <i><a href="#cobjinfo">CObjectTypeInfo</a></i> classes that
provide a more safe and friendly user interface to type information.
<p><a NAME="motivation"></a>
<h3>
Motivation</h3>
We use a simple example to help motivate the use of this <i>type</i> and
<i>object</i>
information model. Let us suppose that we would like to have a generic
function <i>LoadObject()</i>, which can populate an object using data read
from a flat file. For example, we might like to have:
<center><pre>bool LoadObject(Object&amp; myObj, istream&amp; is);</pre></center>
where <i>myObj</i> is an instance of some subclass of <i>Object</i>. Assuming
that the text in the file is of the form:

<pre>
MemberName1 value1
MemberName5 value5
MemberName2 value2
:</pre>

we would like to find the corresponding data member in <i>myObj</i> for
each <i>MemberName</i>, and set that data member's value accordingly. Unfortunately,
<i>myObj</i>
cannot directly supply any useful type information, as the member names
we seek are for a specific subclass of <i>Object</i>. Now suppose that
we have an appropriate type information object available for
<i>myObj</i>,
and consider how this might be used:<a NAME="example"></a>

<pre>
bool LoadObject(TypeInfo&amp; info, Object&amp; myObj, istream&amp; is)
{
    string myName, myValue;

    while ( !is.eof() ) {
        is >> myName >> myValue;
        void* member = FindMember(info, myObj, myName);
        AssignValue(member, myValue);
    }
}
</pre>
Here, we assume that our type information object, <i>info</i>, stores information
about the memory offset of each data member in <i>myObj</i>, and that such
information can be retrieved using some sort of identifying member name
such as <i>myName</i>. This is not too difficult to imagine, and indeed,
this is exactly the type of information and facility provided by the C++
Toolkit's type information classes. The <i>FindMember()</i> function just
needs to return a <i>void</i> pointer to the appropriate location in memory.
The A<i>ssignValue()</i> function presents a much greater challenge however,
as its two sole arguments are a <i>void</i> pointer and a <i>string</i>.
This would be fine if the data member was indeed a <i>void</i> pointer,
and a <i>string</i> value was acceptable. In general this is not the case,
and stronger methods are clearly needed.
<p>In particular, for each data member encountered, we need to retrieve
the type of that member as well as its location in memory, so as to process
<i>myValue</i>
appropriately before assigning it. In addition, we need safer mechanisms
for making such "untyped" assignments. Ideally, we would like a
<i>FindMember()</i>
function that returns a correctly cast pointer to that data member, along
with its associated type information. This is what the <a href="#ref_ObjectInfo"><i>object</i>
information classes</a> provide - a pointer to the object <i>instance</i>
as well as a pointer to its static <i>type</i> information. The interface
to the <a href="#ref_ObjectInfo"><i>object</i> information class</a> also
provides a number of methods such as
<i>GetClassMember(), GetTypeFamily(),
SetPrimitiveValue()</i>, etc., to support the type of activity described
above.

<a NAME="objtype"></a>
<h4>
<i><a href="../docxx/CObjectTypeInfo.html">CObjectTypeInfo</a></i></h4>
This is the base class for all <i>object</i> information classes. It is
intended for usage where there is <i>no</i> concrete object being referenced,
and all that is required is access to the type information. A <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i>
contains a pointer to a low-level <i>CTypeInfo</i> object, and functions
as a user-friendly wrapper class.
<p>The constructor for <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> takes a pointer to a <i>const
CTypeInfo</i> object as its single argument. This is precisely what is
returned by all of the static <i>GetTypeInfo()</i> functions. Thus, to
create a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> for the <i>CBioseq</i> class - without
reference to any particular instance of <i>CBioseq</i> - one might use:
<center>
<p><i>CObjectTypeInfo objInfo( CBioseq::GetTypeInfo() );</i></center>

<p>One of the most important methods provided by the <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i>
class interface is
<i>GetTypeFamily()</i>, which returns an enumerated
value indicating the <i>type family</i> for the object of interest. Five
type families are defined by the <i><a href="../lxr/ident?i=ETypeFamily">ETypeFamily</a></i>
enumeration:

<pre>
ETypeFamily GetTypeFamily(void) const;
    enum ETypeFamily {
    eTypeFamilyPrimitive,
    eTypeFamilyClass,
    eTypeFamilyChoice,
    eTypeFamilyContainer,
    eTypeFamilyPointer
};
</pre>

Different queries become appropriate depending on the <i>ETypeFamily</i>
of the object. For example, if the object is a container, one might need
to determine the type of container (e.g. whether it is a <i>list, map</i>
etc.), and the type of element. Similarly, if an object is a primitive
type (e.g. <i>int, float, string, </i>etc.), an appropriate query becomes
what the value type is, and in the case of integer-valued types, whether
or not it is signed. Finally, in the case of more complex objects such
as class and choice objects, access to the type information for the individual
data members and choice variants is needed. The following methods are included
in the <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> interface for these purposes:
<ul>
<li>
<i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyPrimitive</i>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<i>EPrimitiveValueType GetPrimitiveValueType(void) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>bool IsPrimitiveValueSigned(void) const;</i><a NAME="cmemit"></a></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyClass</i>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<i>CMemberIterator BeginMembers(void) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>CMemberIterator FindMember(const string&amp; memberName) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>CMemberIterator FindMemberByTag(int memberTag) const;</i><a NAME="cvarit"></a></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyChoice</i>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<i>CVariantIterator BeginVariants(void) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>CVariantIterator FindVariant(const string&amp; memberName) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>CVariantIterator FindVariantByTag(int memberTag) const;</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyContainer</i>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<i>EContainerType GetContainerType(void) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>CObjectTypeInfo GetElementType(void) const;</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyPointer</i>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<i>CObjectTypeInfo GetPointedType(void) const;</i></li>
</ul>
</ul>
The two additional enumerations referred to here, <i><a href="../lxr/ident?i=EContainerType">EContainerType</a></i>
and <i><a href="../lxr/ident?i=EPrimitiveValueType">EPrimitiveValueType</a></i>,
are defined, along with <i>ETypeFamily</i>, in <i><a href="../lxr/source/include/serial/serialdef.hpp">include/serial/serialdef.hpp</a></i>.
<p>Different iterator classes are used for iterating over class data members
versus choice variant types. Thus, if the object of interest is a C++ <i>class</i>
object, then access to the type information for its members can be gained
using a
<i>CObjectTypeInfo::CMemberIterator</i>. The <i>BeginMembers()</i>
method returns a <i>CMemberIterator</i> pointing to the first data member
in the class; the <i>FindMember*()</i> methods return a <i>CMemberIterator</i>
pointing to a data member whose name or tag matches the input argument.
The <i>CMemberIterator</i> class is a forward iterator whose operators
are defined as follows:
<ul>
<li>
the <i>++</i> operator increments the iterator (makes it point to the next
class member)</li>

<li>
the <i>()</i> operator tests that the iterator has not exceeded the legitimate
range</li>

<li>
the <i>*</i> dereferencing operator returns a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> for
the data member the iterator currently points to</li>
</ul>
Similarly, the <i>BeginVariants()</i> and <i>FindVariant()</i> methods
allow iteration over the choice variant data types for a choice class,
and the dereferencing operation yields a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> object
for the choice variant currently pointed to by the iterator.
<p><a NAME="constobj"></a>
<h4>
<i><a href="../docxx/CConstObjectInfo.html">CConstObjectInfo</a></i></h4>
The <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> (derived from <i><a href="#objtype">CObjectTypeInfo</a></i>)
adds an interface to access the particular <i>instance</i> of an object
(in addition to the interface inherited from <i><a href="#objtype">CObjectTypeInfo,</a></i>
which provides access to <b><i>type</i></b> information only). It is intended
for usage with <i>const</i> instances of the object of interest, and therefore
the interface does not permit any modifications to the object. The constructor
for
<i>CConstObjectInfo</i> takes two arguments:
<center>
<p><i>CConstObjectInfo(const void* instancePtr, const CTypeInfo* typeinfoPtr);</i></center>

<p>(Alternatively, the constructor can be invoked with a single STL <i>pair</i>
containing these two objects.)
<p>Each <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> contains a pointer to the object's type
information as well as a pointer to an instance of the object. The existence
or validity of this instance can be checked using any of the following
<i>CConstObjectInfo</i>
methods and operators:
<ul>
<li>
<i>bool Valid(void) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>operator bool(void) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>bool operator!(void) const;</i></li>
</ul>
For <i>primitive</i> type objects, the <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> interface
provides access to the currently assigned value using <i>GetPrimitiveValueXxx()</i>.
Here, <i>Xxx</i> may be <i>Bool, Char, Long, ULong, Double, String, ValueString,</i>
or <i>OctetString</i>. In general, to get a primitive value, one first
applies a <i>switch</i> statement to the value returned by <i>GetPrimitiveValueType()</i>,
and then calls the appropriate <i>GetPrimitiveValueXxx()</i> method depending
on the branch followed, e.g.:

<pre>
switch ( obj.GetPrimitiveValueType() ) {

case ePrimitiveValueBool:
    bool b = obj.GetPrimitiveValueBool();
    break;

case ePrimitiveValueInteger:
    if ( obj.IsPrimitiveValueSigned() ) {
       long l = obj.GetPrimitiveValueLong();
    } else {
       unsigned long ul = obj.GetPrimitiveValueULong();
    }
    break;

    //... etc.
}
</pre>

Member iterator methods are also defined in the <i>CConstObjectInfo</i>
class, with a similar interface to that found in the <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i>
class. In this case however, the dereferencing operators return a <i>CConstObjectInfo</i>
object - <i>not</i> a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> object - for the current member.
For C++ <i>class</i> objects, these member functions are:
<ul>
<li>
<i>CMemberIterator BeginMembers(void) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>CMemberIterator FindClassMember(const string&amp; memberName) const;</i></li>

<li>
<i>CMemberIterator FindClassMemberByTag(int memberTag) const;</i></li>
</ul>
For C++ <i>choice</i> objects, only one variant is ever selected, and only
that choice variant is instantiated. As it does not make sense to define
a <i>CConstObjectInfo iterator</i> for uninstantiated variants, the method
<i>GetCurrentChoiceVariant()</i>
is provided instead. The dereferencing operator (*) can be applied to the
object returned by this method to obtain a
<i>CConstObjectInfo</i> for
the variant. Of course, type information for unselected variants can still
be accessed using the <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> methods.
<p>The <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> class also defines an <i>element</i> iterator
for container type objects. <i>CConstObjectInfo::CElementIterator</i> is
a forward iterator whose interface includes increment and testing operators.
Dereferencing is implemented by the iterator's <i>GetElement()</i> method,
which returns a <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> for the element currently pointed
to by the iterator.
<p>Finally, for <i>pointer</i> type objects, the type returned by the method
<i>GetPointedObject()</i>
is also a <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> for the object - not just a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i>.
<p><a NAME="objinfo"></a>
<h4>
<i><a href="../docxx/CObjectInfo.html">CObjectInfo</a></i></h4>
The <i>CObjectInfo</i> class is in turn derived from <i>CConstObjectInfo</i>,
and is intended for usage with <i>mutable</i> instances of the object of
interest. In addition to all of the methods inherited from the parent class,
the interface to this class also provides methods that allow modification
of the object itself or its data members.
<p>For <i>primitive</i> type objects, a set of <i>SetPrimitiveValueXxx()</i>
methods are available, complimentary to the <i>GetPrimitiveValueXxx()</i>
methods described above. Methods that return member iterator objects are
again reimplemented, and the de-referencing operators now return a
<i>CObjectInfo</i>
object for that data member. As the <i>CObjectInfo</i> now points to a
<i>mutable</i>
object, these iterators can be used to set values for the data member.
Similarly, <i>GetCurrentChoiceVariant()</i> now returns a <i>CObjectInfo,</i>
as does <i>CObjectInfo::CElementIterator::GetElement()</i>.
<p><a NAME="usage"></a>
<h3>
Usage of object type information</h3>
We can now reconsider how our <i><a href="#example">LoadObject()</a></i>
function might be implemented using the <i>CObjectInfo</i> class:

<pre>
bool LoadObject(CObjectInfo&amp; info, CNcbiIStream&amp; is)
{
    string alias, myValue;

    while ( !is.eof() ) {
        is >> alias >> myValue;

        CObjectInfo dataMember(*info.FindClassMember(alias));
        if (!dataMember) {
           ERR_POST(ERROR, "Couldn't find member named:" &lt;&lt; alias);
        }
        SetValue(dataMember, myValue);
    }
}
</pre>

Here, <i>"info"</i> contains pointers to the <i>CObject</i> itself as well
as to its associated <i>CTypeInfo</i> object. For each member alias read
from the file, we apply <i>FindClassMember(alias)</i>, and dereference
the returned iterator to retrieve a <i>CObjectInfo</i> object for that
member. We then use the operator <i>()</i> to verify that the member was
located, and if so, use the member's <i>CObjectInfo</i> to set a value
in the function <i>SetValue()</i>:

<pre>
void SetValue(const CObjectInfo&amp; obj, const string value)
{
    if (obj.GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyPrimitive) {

        switch ( obj.GetPrimitiveValueType() ) {

        case ePrimitiveValueBool:
            obj.SetPrimitiveValueBool (atoi (value.c_str()));
            break;
   
        case ePrimitiveValueChar:
            obj.SetPrimitiveValueChar (value.c_str()[0]);
            break;

        //... etc
        }
    } else {
        ERR_POST(ERROR, "Attempt to assign non-primitive from string:" &lt;&lt; value);
    }
}
</pre>

In this example, <i>SetValue()</i> can only assign primitive types. More
generally however, the <i>CObjectInfo</i> class allows the assignment of
more complex types that are simply not implemented here. Note also that
the arguments to <i>SetValue()</i> are <i>const</i>, even though the function
<i>does</i>
modify the value of the data instance pointed to. In particular, the type
<i>const
CObjectInfo</i> should not be confused with the type
<i>CConstObjectInfo</i>.
The former specifies that object information construct is non-mutable,
although the <i>instance</i> it points to can be modified. The latter specifies
that the <i>instance</i> itself is non-mutable.
<p>In addition to user-specific applications of the type demonstrated in
this example, the generic implementations of the <i><a href="iterators.html">C++
type iterators</a></i> and the <i><a href="objstream.html">CObject[IO]Stream
</a></i>class
methods provide excellent examples of how runtime object type information
can be deployed.
<p>As a final example of how type information might be used, we consider
an application whose simple task is to translate a data file on an input
stream to a different format on an output stream. One important use of
the object classes defined in <i>include/objects</i> is the hooks and parsing
mechanisms available to applications utilizing <a href="objstream.html"><i>CObject[IO]Stream</i>s</a>.
The stream objects specialize in different formats (such as XML or ASN.1),
and must work in concert with these type-specific object classes to interpret
or generate serialized data. In some cases however, the dynamic memory
allocation required for large objects may be substantial, and it is preferable
to avoid actually instantiating a whole object all at once.
<p>Instead, it is possible to use the <i><a href="../docxx/CObjectStreamCopier.html">CObjectStreamCopier</a></i>
class, described in <i><a href="objstream.html">CObject[IO]Streams</a></i>.
Briefly, this class holds two <i>CObject[IO]Stream</i> data members pointing
to the input and output streams, and a set of <i>Copy</i> methods which
take a
<i>CTypeInfo</i> argument. Using this class, it is easy to translate
files between different formats; for example:

<pre>
auto_ptr&lt;CObjectIStream>  in(CObjectIStream::Open("mydata.xml",eSerial_Xml));
auto_ptr&lt;CObjectOStream> out(CObjectOStream::Open("mydata.asn",eSerial_AsnBinary));
CObjectStreamCopier copier(*in, *out);
copier.Copy (CBioseq_set::GetTypeInfo());
</pre>

copies a <i>CBioseq_set</i> encoded in XML to a new file, reformatted in
ASN.1 binary format.
