Although this discussion focuses on ASN.1 and XML formatted data, the data structures and tools
described here have been designed to (potentially) support any formalized serial data
specification.  Many of the tools and objects have open-ended abstract or template
implementations that can be instantiated differently to fit various specifications. <p>

<a name="headersandlibs"></a>
<h3> Accessing the object header files and serialization libraries </h3>

Reading and writing serialized data is implemented by an integrated set of streams, filters,
and object types. An application that reads encoded data files will require the object header
files and libraries which define how these serial streams of data should be loaded into
memory. This entails <i>#include</i> statements in your source files, as well as the associated
library specifications in your makefiles.  The object header and implementation files are
located in the
<a href="../lxr/source/include/objects/">
<i>include/objects</i></a> and
<a href="../lxr/source/src/objects/">
<i>src/objects</i></a> subtrees of the C++ tree,
respectively. The header and implementation files for serialized streams and type
information are in the
<a href="../lxr/source/include/serial/">
<i>include/serial</i></a> and
<a href="../lxr/source/src/serial/">
<i>src/serial</i></a> directories.
<p>

If you have checked out the <i> objects</i> directories, but not explicitly run the
<a href="../tools/datatool/datatool.html">
<i>datatool</i></a> code generator, then you will find that your <i>include/objects</i>
subdirectories are (almost) empty, and the source subdirectories contain only makefiles and
ASN.1 specifications. These makefiles and ASN.1 specifications can be used to build your own
copies of the objects' header and implementation files, using <i>make all_r</i> (if you
configured using the <i>--with-objects</i> flag), or running datatool explicitly.<p>

However, building your own local copies of these header and implementation files is neither
necessary nor recommended, as it is simpler to use the pre-generated header files and prebuilt
libraries.  The pre-built header and implementation files can be found in <i>
$NCBI/c++/include/objects/</i> and <i> $NCBI/c++/src/objects/</i>, respectively.  Assuming your
makefile defines an include path to <i>$NCBI/c++/include</i>, selected object header files such
as
<a href="../lxr/source/include/objects/general/Date.hpp">
<i> Date.hpp</i></a>, can be included as:
<center>
<xmp>
#include <objects/general/Date.hpp>
</xmp>
</center>

This header file (along with its implementations in the accompanying <i>src</i> directory) was
generated by <a href="../tools/datatool/datatool.html">
<i> datatool</i></a> using the specifications from
<a href="../lxr/source/src/objects/general/general.asn">
<i>src/objects/general/general.asn</i></a>. In order to use the classes defined in the <i>objects</i>
directories, your source code should begin with the statements:
<font color="gray"><pre>    USING_NCBI_SCOPE;
    using namespace objects;
</pre></font>

All of the objects' header and implementation files are generated by <i>datatool</i>, as specified
in the ASN.1 specification files. The resulting object definitions however, are <i>not</i> in any
way dependent on ASN.1 format, as they simply specify the in-memory representation of the defined
data types. Accordingly, the objects themselves can be used to read, interpret, and write any
type of serialized data. Format specializations on the input stream are implemented via
<a href="../docxx/CObjectIStream.html">
<i>CObjectIStream</i></a> objects, which extract the required tags and values from the input data
according to the format specified. Similarly, Format specializations on an output stream are implemented via
<a href="../docxx/CObjectOStream.html">
<i>CObjectOStream</i></a> objects.

<a name="example1"></a>
<h3> Reading and writing serial data </h3>

Let's consider a program <a href="xml2asn_cpp.html"> <i>xml2asn.cpp</i></a> that translates an
XML data file containing an object of type
<a href="../lxr/source/src/objects/mmdb1/mmdb1.asn">
<i>Biostruc</i></a>, to ASN.1 text and binary formats.

In <i>main()</i>, we begin by initializing the diagnostic stream to write errors to a local
file called <i> xml2asn.log</i>. (Exception handling, program tracing, and error logging are
described in the <a href="diag.html"> <i>Diagnostic Streams</i> </a> section).<p>

An instance of the <i>CTestAsn</i> class is then created, and its member function
<i>AppMain()</i> is invoked. This function in turn calls <i>CTestAsn::Run()</i>.  The first
three lines of code there define the XML input and ASN.1 output streams, using <a
href="cref.html"> <i>auto_ptr</i></a>s, to ensure automatic destruction of these objects.<p>

Each stream is associated with data serialization mechanisms appropriate to the
<a href="../lxr/ident?i=ESerialDataFormat">
<i>ESerialDataFormat</i></a> provided to the constructor:

<font color=gray><pre>
enum ESerialDataFormat {
    eSerial_None         = 0,
    eSerial_AsnText      = 1,      // open ASN.1 text format
    eSerial_AsnBinary    = 2,      // open ASN.1 binary format
    eSerial_Xml          = 3       // open XML format (not supported yet)
};
</pre></font>

<i> CObjectIStream</i> and <i>CObjectOStream</i> are base classes which provide generic
interfaces between the specific type information of a serializable object and an I/O
stream. The object stream classes that will actually be instantiated by this application,
<a href="../docxx/CObjectIStreamXml.html">
<i>CObjectIStreamXml</i></a>,
<a href="../docxx/CObjectOStreamAsn.html">
<i>CObjectOStreamAsn</i></a>, and
<a href="../docxx/CObjectOStreamAsnBinary.html">
<i>CObjectOStreamAsnBinary</i></a>,
are descendants of these base classes.
<p>

Finally, a variable for the object type that will be generated from the input stream (in this case a
<a href="../docxx/CBiostruc.html"> <i> CBiostruc</i></a>) is defined, and the
<i>CObject[I/O]Stream</i> operators "<<" and ">>" are used to read and write the serialized data to
and from the object. (Note that it is <i> not </i> possible to simply "pass the data through", from
the input stream to the output stream, using a construct like:<i> *inObject >> *outObject</i>). The
<i>CObject[I/O]Stream</i>s know nothing about the structure of the specific object - they have
knowledge only of the serialization format (text ASN, binary ASN, XML, etc.). In contrast, the <a
href="../docxx/CBiostruc.html"> <i>CBiostruc</i></a> knows nothing about I/O and serialization
formats, but it contains explicit type information about itself.  Thus, the
<i>CObject[I/O]Stream</i>s can apply their specialized serialization methods to the data members of
<i>CBiostruc</i> using the <a href="typeinfo.html#ctypeinfo"><i>type information</i></a> associated with
that object's class.

<h3>Determining Which Header Files to Include </h3>

As always, we include the <i>corelib</i> header files, <i>ncbistd.hpp</i> and <i>ncbiapp.hpp</i>.
In addition, the <i>serial</i> header files that define the generic <i>CObject[IO]Stream</i>
objects are included, along with <i>serial.hpp</i>, which defines generalized serialization
mechanisms. Finally, we need to include the header file for the object type we will be using.<p>

There are two source browsers that can be used to locate the appropriate header file for a
particular object type. All class names in the NCBI C++ Toolkit begin with the letter
"C". Using the <a href="../docxx/HIER.html"> class
hierarchy browser</a>, we find <i>CBiostruc</i>, derived from <i>CBiostruc_Base</i>, which is
in turn derived from <i>CObject</i>. Following the <i>CBiostruc</i> link, we can then use the
<i>locate</i> button to move to the <i>LXR</i> source code navigator, and there, find the name
of the header file. In this case, we find
<a href="../lxr/source/include/objects/mmdb1/Biostruc.hpp">
<i>CBiostruc.hpp</i></a> is located in
<i>include/objects/mmdb1</i>.  Alternatively, if we know the name of the C++ class, the source
code navigator's <a href="../lxr/ident">
identifier search</a> tool can be used directly. In summary, the
following <i>#include</i> statements appear at the top of <a href="xml2asn_cpp.html"><i>xml2asn.cpp</i></a>:

<xmp>
#include <corelib/ncbistd.hpp>
#include <corelib/ncbiapp.hpp>
#include <serial/serial.hpp>
#include <serial/objistr.hpp>
#include <serial/objostr.hpp>
#include <objects/mmdb1/Biostruc.hpp>
</xmp>

<h3>Determining Which Libraries to Link To </h3>
Determining which libraries must be linked to requires a bit more work and may involve
some trial and error. The list of available libraries currently includes:<p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>access	<td>medlars	<td>ncbimime	<td>seq		<td>seqloc	<td>xconnect </tr>
<tr><td>biblio	<td>medline	<td>objprt	<td>seqalign	<td>seqres	<td>xfcgi </tr>
<tr><td>cdd	<td>mmdb1	<td>proj	<td>seqblock	<td>seqset	<td>xhtml </tr>
<tr><td>featdef	<td>mmdb2	<td>pub		<td>seqcode	<td>submit	<td>xncbi </tr>
<tr><td>general	<td>mmdb3	<td>pubmed	<td>seqfeat	<td>xcgi	<td>xser </tr>
</table><p>

It should be clear that we will need to link to the core library,
<a href="../libs.html#ref_TableXNCBI"><i>xncbi</i></a>, as
well as to the serial library,
<a href="../libs.html#ref_TableXSERIAL">
<i>xser</i></a>. In addition, we will need to link to whatever object libraries are
entailed by using a
<a href="../docxx/CBiostruc.html">
<i>CBiostruc.</i></a> object. Minimally, one would
expect to link to the <i>mmdb</i> libraries. This in itself is insufficient however,
as the <i>CBiostruc</i> class embeds other types of objects, including PubMed citations,
features, and sequences, which in turn embed additional objects such as
<a href="../docxx/CDate.html">
<i>Date</i></a>.
The makefile for <i>xml2asn.cpp</i>, <a href="make_xml2asn.html"> <i>Makefile.xml2asn.app</i></a> lists
the libraries required for linking in the make variable <i>LIB</i>.
<p>

See also the example program,
<a href="../lxr/source/src/objects/asn2asn/asn2asn.cpp">
<i>asn2asn.cpp</i></a> which demonstrates more generalized translation of <i> Seq-entry</i> and
<i> Bioseq-set</i> types (defined in
<a href="../lxr/source/src/objects/seqset/seqset.asn">
<i>seqset.asn</i></a>).
