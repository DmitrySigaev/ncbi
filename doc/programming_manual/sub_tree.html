<h1>Working Independently In a C++ Subtree</h1>

An alternative to developing a new project from scratch is to work within a subtree of the
main NCBI C++ source tree so as to utilize the header, source, and make files defined for that
subtree. One way to do this would be to check out the entire source tree and then do all
your work within the selected subtree(s) only. A better solution is to create a new
working directory and check out only the relevant subtrees into that directory. This is
somewhat complicated by the distributed organization of the C++ CVS tree: header files are
(recursively) contained in an <i> include </i> subtree, while source files are
(recursively) contained in a <i> src </i> subtree.  Thus, multiple checkouts may be
required to set things up properly, and the customized makefiles (<i>Makefile.*.app</i>) will
need to be modified. The shell script <a href="../new_proj.html#ref_OutsideImport">
<i> import_project.sh </i></a> will do all of this
for you. The syntax is:
<xmp>
   import_project.sh  subtree_name  [builddir]
</xmp>
where:
<dl>
  <dt> - <i> subtree </i> is the path to a selected directory inside <i>internal/c++/src/</i>
  <dt> - <i> builddir </i> (optional) specifies what version of the pre-built NCBI C++ Toolkit libraries to link to
</dl>

As a result of executing this shell script, you will have a new directory created with the
pathname <i>./internal/c++/</i> whose structure contains "slices" of the original CVS
tree. Specifically, you will find:

<dl> <i>
<dt> ./internal/c++/include/subtree_name
<dt> ./internal/c++/src/subtree_name
</dl> </i>

The <i>src</i> and <i>include</i> directories will contain all of the requested subtree's source and
header files along with any hierarchically defined subdirectories. In addition, the script
will create new makefiles with the suffix <i>*_app</i>. These makefiles are generated from the
orginal <a href="../new_proj.html#ref_MakeProjApp"> customized make files</a>
(<i>Makefile.*.app</i>) located in the original <i>src</i> subtrees.
The customized makefiles were designed to work only in conjunction with the build
directories in the larger NCBI C++ tree; the newly created makefiles can be used directly in
your new working directories.<p>

The NCBI C++ Toolkit project directories, along with the libraries they implement and the
logical modules they entail, are summarized in the Reference Manual page
<a href="../libs.html"> <i>NCBI C++ libraries</i></a>.
Currently, there are eight project directories in the <a href="../src_tree.gif">NCBI C++
source tree</a>, including:

<ul>
 <li> <i> corelib </i> - libraries for the Toolkit foundations
 <li> <i> connect </i> - libraries providing client/server connections
 <li> <i> cgi </i> - libraries for developing CGI applications
 <li> <i> html </i> - libraries for developing HTML pages
 <li> <i> serial </i> - libraries for handling ASN, XML and files of other specified formats
 <li> <i> hello </i> - a simple example project that incorporates all but the serial libraries
</ul>

Two other project directories, <i> internal </i> and <i> objects</i>, are not intended for
general use, and the mechanisms in the <a
href="../new_proj.html#ref_OutsideImport"><i>import_project.sh</i></a> script for generating
makefiles are not guaranteed to work for these.  The <i> objects </i> subdirectories are used
as the original repositories for ASN.1 specifications, and subsequently, for writing the object
definitions and implementations created by the <i> datatool </i> program. These definitions are
available for use in your application as described in the section <a href="asn.html">
<i>Processing ASN.1 Data</i></a>. The <i> internal </i> subdirectory is used for in-house
development, and is the recommended work area for <i> new </i> projects.<p>
