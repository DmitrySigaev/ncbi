The previous two chapters described the NCBI C++ Toolkit's <a href="cgi.html"> CGI</a> and
<a href="webpgs.html"> HTML</a> classes, with an emphasis on their independence from one 
another. In practice however, a real application must employ both types of objects, with
a good deal of inter-dependency. <p>

As described in the description of the CGI classes, the <a href="cgi.html#cncbires">
<i>CNcbiResource</i></a> class can be used to implement an application whose functionality varies
with the query string. Specifically, the resource class contains a list of <i>CNcbiCommand</i>
objects, each of which has a defined <i>GetName()</i> and <i>GetEntry() </i> method. The only command
selected for execution on a given query is the one whose <i>GetName()</i> and <i>GetEntry()</i> values
match the leading <i>key=value</i> pair in the query string.<p>

The <a href="../tools/hello/hello.html"> <i>hello</i></a> demo program provides an example of using
these CGI mechanisms as they were intended for complex applications requiring this kind of
flexibility. The <i>CHelloResource</i> class has different commands which will be executed depending
on whether the query string invoked an <i>init</i> or a <i>reply</i> command.  For many applications
however, this selection mechanism adds unnecessary complexity to the interface, as the application
always performs the same function, albeit on different input. In these cases, there is no need to
use a <i>CNcbiResource</i> object, or <i>CNcbiCommand</i> objects, as the application's
functionality can be encoded directly in the application's <i>ProcessRequest()</i> method. The
example program described in this section uses this simpler approach.<p>

<a name="descrip"> <h3> Program description </h3>

The <a href="http://ray:6224/staff/zimmerman/car.cgi"><i>car.cgi</i></a> program presents an HTML
form for ordering a custom color car with selected features. The form includes a group of checkboxes
(listing individual features) and a set of radio buttons listing possible colors. Initially, no
features are selected, and the default color is white. Following the form, a summary stating the
currently selected features and color, along with a price quote, is displayed. <p>

The program uses a <a href="../docxx/CHTMLPage.html"><i>CHTMLPage</i></a> object with a template
file (<a href="car.html"><i>car.html</i></a>) to create the display. The template file contains
three &lt;@tag@&gt; locations, which the program uses to map <i>CNCBINode</i>s to the page, using
the <i>AddTagMap()</i> method.  Here is an outline of the execution sequence:

<ol>
<li> Create an instance of class <i>CCar</i> named <i>car</i>.<p>

<li> Create a <i>CHTMLPage</i> named <i>page</i>.<p>

<li> Load <i>car</i> with the color and features specified in the query string. <p>

<li> Generate a <i>CHTML_form</i> object using the features and color currently selected
for <i>car</i>, and map that HTML form to the &lt;@FORM@&gt; tag in <i>page</i>.<p>

<li> Generate the summary statement and save it in a <i>CHTMLText</i> node mapped
to the &lt;@SUMMARY@&gt; tag.<p>

<li> Generate a price quote and save it in a <i>CHTMLText</i> node mapped to the &lt;@PRICE@&gt; tag,<p>

<li> Output <i>page</i> and exit.
</ol>
<p>
The <i>CCar</i> created in step 1 initially has the default color (white) and no features. Any features or colors
specified in the query string with which the program was invoked are added to <i>car</i> in step 3, prior
to generating the HTML display elements. In step 4, the form element is created using the lists of
possible features and colors stored as static data members in class <i>CCar</i>. Each feature corresponds
to a <i>CHTML_checkbox</i> element in the form, and each color corresponds to a <i>CHTML_radio</i> button.
The selected color, along with all currently selected features will be displayed as selected in the form.<p>

The summary statement uses a <i>CHTML_ol</i> list element to itemize the selected features in <i>car</i>.
The price is calculated as <i>CCar::m_BasePrice</i> (a static data member) plus an additional $1000 per
feature. The <i>submit</i> button generates a fresh page with the new query string, as the <i>action</i>
attribute of the form is the URL of <i>car.cgi</i>.
