<h1> Working within the C++ source tree </h1>
Most users will find that working in a <i>checked-out</i> subtree or a private
directory is preferable to working directly in the C++ source tree. There are
two good reasons to avoid doing so:
<ol>
<li> Building your own versions of the extensive libraries can be very time-consuming.
<li> There is no guarantee that the library utilities your private code links to have not
become obsolete.
</ol>

This section is provided for those developers who must work within the source tree.  The
Reference Manual sections provide more complete and technical discussion of
the topics reviewed here, and many links to the relevant sections are provided. This
page is provided as an overview of material presented in the 
<a href="../new_proj.html#ref_Makefile">
Reference Manual</a>.

<a name="checkout">

<a href="../config.html#ref_Source"><h3> Checkout the source tree and build the
libraries</h3></a> Since you will be working inside the C++ source tree you will first
need to checkout <i>$CVSROOT/internal/c++</i>. If you do not wish to include all of the
subprojects contained in <i>$CVSROOT/internal/c++/internal</i>, you may want to use
<i>cvs_core.sh</i> or <i>cvs_core_msvc.bat</i> (provided in the <a
href="../new_proj.html#ref_Checkout"><i>scripts</i></a> directory) for checking out. 

Once you have done so, you will
need to run one of the configure scripts in the <i>internal/c++</i> directory.
For example, to configure your environment to work with the <i>gcc</i> compiler
on Solaris, use: <i>./configure</i>.

The <a href="../config.html#ref_Configure"><i>configure script</i></a> is a multi-platform
configuration shell script (generated from <i>configure.in</i> using
<i>autoconf</i>). Here are some pointers to sections in the Reference Manual that will
help you configure the build environment:
<ul>
<li> <a href="../config.html#ref_Wrappers"> Wrapper scripts</a> supporting various platforms
<li> <a href="../config.html#ref_Running"> Optional configuration flags</a>
</ul>

The configure script concludes with a message describing how to build the C++ Toolkit
libraries. If your application will be working with ASN.1 data, use the <i>--with-objects</i> flag
in running the <i>configure</i> script, so as to populate the <i>include/objects</i> and
<i>src/objects</i> subdirectories.

<a name="makefiles">
<h3> The project's directories and makefiles </h3>

To start a new project ("<i>myProj</i>"), you should begin by creating both a <i>src</i>
and an <i>include</i> subtree for that project inside the C++ tree.  In general, all
header files that will be accessed by multiple source modules outside the project
directory should be written to the <i>include</i> directory. Header files that will be used
solely inside the project's <i>src</i> directory should be written there, along with the
implementation files. <p>

In addition to the C++ source
files, the <i>src</i> subtrees contain <i>meta-makefiles</i> named <i>Makefile*.in</i>,
which are used by the configure script to generate corresponding <i>makefiles</i> in the
<i>build</i> subtrees. Figure 1 shows slices of the directory structure reflecting the
correspondences between the meta-makefiles in the <i>src</i> subtrees and makefiles in the
<i>build</i> subtrees. Each of the <i>meta-makefiles</i> in the top-level <i>src</i> tree
has a corresponding <i>Makefile*</i> in the top-level of the build tree. Thus, you will also need
to create a <i>meta-makefile</i> in the newly created <i>src/myProj</i> directory before
reconfiguring your build directory to include the new project. The configure script will 
then create the corresponding subtree in the <i>build</i> directory, along with a new <i>Makefile</i>
generated from the <i>Makefile.in</i> you created.

The file <i>myProj/Makefile.in</i> should contain macros whose definitions have 
the following interpretation:

<ul> 
<li> <i>LIB_PROJ</i> (optional) - a list of names for library targets
<li> <i>APP_PROJ</i> (optional) - a list of names for application targets
<li> <i>SUB_PROJ</i> (optional) - a list of names for subdirectory targets (used on recursive builds)
<li> <i>USR_PROJ</i> (optional) - a list of names for user-defined makefile targets
<li> <i>srcdir</i> (required) - the alias (<i>@srcdir@</i>) for this directory (as defined in <i>Makefile.mk</i>)
</ul>

The last line in this file should be an <i>include</i> directive specifying the file named
<i>Makefile.meta</i> located in the </i>build</i> directory (aliased as
<i>@builddir@</i>). <p>

The first four macros listed here are used to define the build targets - refer also to the
Reference Manual's description of <a href="../new_proj.html#ref_Makefile"> makefile
targets</a>.  Assuming that <i>myProj</i> is used to develop an application named <i>myProj</i>,
<i>myProj/Makefile.in</i> should contain the following:

<font color=#000080><pre>################################# 
# Meta-makefile for "myProj"
#################################

APP_PROJ = myProj

srcdir = @srcdir@
include @builddir@/Makefile.meta
</pre></font>
The corresponding <i>Makefile</i> in <i>build/myProj</i>
generated by the configure script will then contain:
<font color=#000080><pre># Generated automatically from Makefile.in by configure.
#################################
# $Id$

# Meta-makefile ("myProj" program)
#################################

APP_PROJ = myProj

srcdir = /home/zimmerma/internal/c++/src/myProj
include /home/zimmerma/internal/c++/myBuild/build/Makefile.meta
</pre></font>

As demonstrated in this example, the <i>@srcdir@</i> and <i>@builddir@</i> aliases in the
makefile template have been replaced with absolute paths in the generated <i>Makefile</i>. This
is accomplished by the silent inclusion of <i>build/Makefile.mk</i> in all generated
makefiles, as described in the Reference Manual section on <a
href="http://sunweb.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:6224/IEB/corelib/cpp/new_proj.html#ref_MakeProjMk">
Makefile.mk</a>.  
<p>
The definition of <i>APP_PROJ</i> is copied verbatim to the generated Makefile. This
defines a list of application objects to build when <i>make</i> 
is executed in the build subdirectory. For each application listed (<i>p1, p2, ...,
pn</i>), you must have created a corresponding <a href="#proj_makes"> project makefile</a>
named <i>Makefile.p*.app</i> located in <i>@srcdir@</i>.  Similarly, the <i>LIB_PROJ</i>
macro can be used to specify a list of libraries (<i>l1, l2, ..., ln</i>) to build, where
each library project also has a corresponding file named <i>Makefile.l*.lib</i> in
<i>@srcdir@</i>.
<p>

The <i>SUB_PROJ</i> macro is used to define recursive build targets; items listed here
define the subdirectories rooted in <i>@srcdir@</i> where <i>make</i> should be executed
recursively.  The configure script will create these relative subdirectories inside the
new <i>build</i> project directory, and generate the new subdirectories' makefiles
from the corresponding meta-makefiles in the <i>src</i> subtrees.  A recursive
build can then be invoked by using "<i>make all_r</i>" in the <i>build</i> subtree; typing
<i>make</i> or <i>make all</i> will only build targets at the top-level. <p>

Finally, the <i>USR_PROJ</i> macro is provided for the specification of build targets whose 
makefiles should be executed directly as:
<center><pre>
make -f $(srcdir)/Makefile.u1 all
</pre></center>
This allows for the execution of individually defined makefiles which do not necessarily follow 
any of the conventions described in this section. <p>

Once you have created the required makefiles in the <i>src</i> subtree, running the 
<a href="../config.html#ref_Reconf"> <i>status/config.status</i></a> script will create the
necessary a build subdirectory of the same name and write the generated makefiles to that directory. 
<p>
Given these makefile definitions, executing <i>make</i> in the <i>build</i> project subdirectory 
causes <i>build/Makefile.meta</i> to be executed, which sets
the following chain of events in motion:

<ul>
 <li> For each <i>proj_name</i> listed in <i>USR_PROJ</i>, 
     <i>make -f $(srcdir)/Makefile.proj_name</i> is executed, and 
     the resulting executables are written to the build subdirectory. NOTE:
     although <i>Makefile.proj_name</i> is located in the same directory as the source files,
     because <i>make</i> is executed from a different directory, complete paths to the
     source files must be given in the makefile.

 <li> For each <i>app_name</i> listed in <i>APP_PROJ</i>, 
     <i>make -f $(builddir)/Makefile.app.tmpl</i> is executed. This in turn specifies 
     that <i>$(builddir)/Makefile.mk, $(srcdir)/Makefile.app_name.app</i>, and <i>$(builddir)/Makefile.app</i>
     should be included in the generated makefile commands that actually get executed. 
     The resulting executables are written to the build subdirectory and copied to 
     the <i>bin</i> subtree. 

 <li> For each <i>lib_name</i> listed in <i>LIB_PROJ</i>, 
     <i>make -f $(builddir)/Makefile.lib.tmpl</i> is executed. This in turn specifies 
     that <i>$(builddir)/Makefile.mk, $(srcdir)/Makefile.lib_name.lib</i>, and <i>$(builddir)/Makefile.lib</i>
     should be included in the generated makefile commands that actually get executed. 
     The resulting libraries are written to the build subdirectory and copied to 
     the <i>lib</i> subtree. 

 <li> For each <i>dir_name</i> listed in <i>SUB_PROJ</i> (on <i>make all_r</i>), 
     <i>cd dir_name</i> is executed and <i>make all_r</i> is executed.

</ul>
<a name="proj_makes"> <a href="../new_proj.html#ref_MakeProjLib"><h3> Makefile.*.lib and Makefile.*.app</h3> </a>
<i>Makefile.lib_name.lib</i> should contain the following macro definitions:
<ul>
  <li> <i> $(LIBOBJ) </i> - the names of all source files to compile and link in building the library
  <li> <i> $(LOBJ) </i> - the names of any pre-compiled object files to include in the linking
  <li> <i> $(LIB)</i> - the name of the library being built
</ul>
For an example, see <a href="http://ray.nlm.nih.gov:6224/intranet/ieb/CPP/lxr/http/source/src/corelib/Makefile.corelib.lib">
Makefile.corelib.lib</a>. <p>
<i>Makefile.proj_name.proj</i> should contain the following macro definitions:
<ul>
  <li><i> $(OBJ) </i> - the names of the object modules to build and link to 
  <li><i> $(LIB)</i> - specific libraries in the NCBI C++ Toolkit to include in the linking
  <li><i> $(LIBS) </i> - all other libraries to link to (outside the C++ Toolkit)
  <li><i> $(APP) </i> - the name of the application being built
</ul>
