All new changes are being made to the Toolkit Book
at the following locations:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Official Release:</i> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">
    C++ Toolkit Book</a>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Development Version:</i> <a href="http://xpubmed0.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:5701/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">

    C++ Toolkit Book (no search engine, accessible from inside NCBI only)</a>. </li> </ul> The Development Version is the most recent documentation before it becomes an Official Release. While the Development Version is the lastest version, it is accessible only from inside NCBI, and the search engine functionality is currently missing. Also, the location of the Development Version may change without warning! So it is suggested that you use the Official Release, and use the Development Version only when necessary.</p> </i>

<h1>NCBI C++ Library Dependency Graph</h1>

<img src="depgraph.gif">

This graph was obtained by building the full toolkit and then
running the following commands:
<pre class="ncbi_cmd">
.../bin/depgraph .../lib/lib* > depgraph.out
.../bin/depgraph2dot -simplify -in depgraph.out -out depgraph.dot
dot -Tps -o depgraph.ps depgraph.dot
convert -density 100 depgraph.ps PPM:- | ppmtogif > depgraph.gif
</pre>
where <span class="ncbi_util">dot</span> comes from AT&amp;T's
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">Graphviz</a>
package.  If you are at NCBI, you can find the source to
<span class="ncbi_app">depgraph</span> and <span class="ncbi_app">depgraph2dot</span>
<a href="http://intranet.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/internal/util/depgraph/">here.</a>
Dashed lines represent containment.
<p>
Alternatively, you may wish to consult the <a href="libdeps.txt">list</a>
of each library's dependencies.  The format of each line is
<span class="ncbi_var">libname: LIB / LIBS</span>, where everything in
<span class="ncbi_var">LIB</span> must follow
<span class="ncbi_var">libname</span> in your makefile's LIB setting and
everything in <span>LIBS</span> must appear in your makefile's LIBS
setting.
<p>
You can find a version of the graph which includes internal projects
<a href="depgraph-full.pdf">here</a>, and a corresponding list
<a href="internal/full-libdeps.txt">here</a>.
<!-- produced as follows:
* \ls $NCBI/c++/Release/lib > all-libs
* pick a single member of each static/dynamic triplet
  (libfoo.a, libfoo.so, libfoo-static.a)
* depgraph `cat all-libs` $NCBI/altlib/libncbi* /usr/lib/libm.a > depgraph-full.out
* egrep -v 'altlib|/usr/lib' depgraph-full.out > depgraph-full.out2
* depgraph2dot -landscape -simplify < depgraph-full.out2 > depgraph-full.dot
* remove "; rotate = 90" from depgraph-full.dot
* dot -Tps -o depgraph-full.out depgraph-full.dot
* distall -pagesize 11 8.5 in depgraph-full.ps
