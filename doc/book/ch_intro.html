One approach is to dive into the details of one component and understand it in sufficient detail to get a roadmap of the rest of the components, and then repeat this process with the other components. Without a formal road map, this approach can be very time consuming and it may take a long time to locate the functionality one needs.</p><p>When trying to understand a major piece of software, it would be more effective if there is a written text that explains the overall framework without getting too lost in the details.

For example, every application upon loading seems to go through a cycle of doing some initialization, then some processing, and upon completion of processing, doing some clean up activity before exiting. These three phases are modeled in the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiApplication</span> class as interface methods <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Init()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Run()</span>, and <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Exit()</span>.</p><p>A new application is written by deriving a class from the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiApplication</span> base class and writing an implementation of the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Init()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Run()</span>, and <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Exit()</span> methods. Execution control to the new application is passed by calling the application object's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">AppMain()</span> method inherited from the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiApplication</span> base class (see <a href="ch_intro.html#ch_intro.F1">Figure 1</a>). The <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">AppMain()</span> method is similar to the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">main()</span> method used in C/C++ programs and calls the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Init()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Run()</span>, and <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Exit()</span> methods.</p><div class="figure" id="ch_intro.F1"><div class="graphic"><img src="img/CNcbiApplication.gif" alt="Figure 1. The CNcbiApplication class" /></div><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiApplication</span> class</p></div></div><p>More details on <a href="ch_core.html#ch_core.writing_simple_app">using the CNcbiApplication class</a> are presented in a later chapter.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_args"><h3><span class="title">Argument processing</span></h3><p>In a C++ program, control is transferred from the command line to the program via the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">main()</span> function. The <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">main()</span> function is passed a count of the number of arguments (int argc), and an array of character strings containing arguments to the program (<span class="nctnt ncbi-code">char** argv</span>). As long as the argument types are simple, one can simply set up a loop to iterate through the array of argument values and process them. However, with time applications evolve and grow more complex. Often there is a need to do some more complex argument checking. For example, the application may want to enforce a check on the number and position of arguments, check the argument type (int, string, etc.), check for constraints on argument values, check for flags, check for arguments that follow a keyword (<span class="nctnt ncbi-func">-logfile mylogfile.log</span>), check for mandatory arguments, display usage help on the arguments, etc.</p><p>To make the above tasks easier, the CORELIB provides a number of portable classes that encapsulate the functionality of argument checking and processing. The main classes that provide this functionality are the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CArgDescriptions</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CArgs</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CArgValue</span> classes.</p><p>Argument descriptions such as the expected number, type, position, mandatory and optional attributes are setup during an application's initilization such as the application object's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Init()</span> method (see <a href="ch_intro.html#ch_intro.intro_appframe">previous section</a>) by calling the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CArgDescriptions</span> class methods. Then, the arguments are extracted by calling the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CArgs</span> class methods.</p><p>More details on <a href="ch_core.html#ch_core.cmd_line_args">argument processing</a> are presented in a later chapter.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_diag"><h3><span class="title">Diagnostics</span></h3><p>It is very useful for an application to post messages about its internal state or other diagnostic information to a file, console or for that matter any output stream. The CORELIB provides a portable diagnostics facility that enables an application to post diagnostic messages of various severity levels to an output stream. This diagnostic facility is provided by the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiDiag</span> class. You can set the diagnostic stream to the standard error output stream (<span class="nctnt ncbi-code">NcbiErr</span>) or to any other output stream.</p><p>You can set the severity level of the message to Information, Warning, Error, Critical, Fatal, or Trace. You can alter the severity level at any time during the use of the diagnostic stream.</p><p>More details on <a href="ch_core.html#ch_core.CNcbiDiag">diagnostic streams</a> and <a href="ch_debug.html#ch_debug.std_cpp_message_post">processing of diagnostic messages</a> are presented in later chapters.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_env"><h3><span class="title">Environment Interface</span></h3><p>An application can read the environment variable settings (such as PATH) that are in affect when the application is run. CORELIB defines a portable <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiEnvironment</span> class that stores the environment variable settings and provides applications with methods to get the environment variable values.</p><p>More details on the <a href="ch_core.html#ch_core.CNcbiEnvironment">environment interface</a> are presented in a later chapter.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_files_dirs"><h3><span class="title">Files and Directories</span></h3><p>An application may need access to information about a file or directory. The CORELIB provides a number of portable classes to model a system file and directory. Some of the important classes are <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CFile</span> for modeling a file, <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDir</span> for modeling a directory, and <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CMemoryFile</span> for memory mapped file.</p><p>For example, if you create a <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CFile</span> object corresponding to a system file, you can get the file's attribute settings such as file size, permission settings, or check the existence of a file. You can get the directory where the file is located, the base name of the file, and the file's extension. There are also a number of useful functions that are made available through these classes to parse a file path or build a file path from the component parts such as a directory, base name, and extension.</p><p>More details on <a href="ch_core.html#ch_core.files_dirs">file and directory classes</a> are presented in later chapters.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_mt_test"><h3><span class="title">MT Test wrappers</span></h3><p>The <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiApplication</span> class which was <a href="ch_intro.html#ch_intro.intro_appframe">discussed earlier</a> provides a framework for writing portable applications. For writing portable multi-threaded applications, the CORELIB provides a <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CThreadedApp</span> class derived from <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiApplication</span> class which provides a framework for building multi-threaded applications.</p><p>Instead of using the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Init()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Run()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Exit()</span> methods for the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CNcbiApplication</span> class, the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CThreadedApp</span> class defines specialized methods such as <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Thread_Init()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Thread_Run()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Thread_Exit()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Thread_Destroy()</span> for controlling thread behavior. These methods operate on a specific thread identified by a thread index parameter.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_cref"><h3><span class="title">Object and Ref classes</span></h3><p>A major cause of errors in C/C++ programs is due to dynamic allocation of memory. Stated simply, memory for objects allocated using the new operator must be released by a corresponding delete operator. Failure to delete allocated memory results in memory leaks. There may also be programming errors caused by references to objects that have never been allocated or improperly allocated. One reason these types of problems crop up are because a programmer may dynamically allocate memory as needed, but may not deallocate it due to unanticipated execution paths.</p><p>The C++ standard provides the use of a template class, auto_ptr , that wraps memory management inside constructors and destructors. Because a destructor is called for every constructed object, memory allocation and deallocation can be kept symmetrical with respect to each other. However, the auto_ptr does not properly handle the issue of ownership when multiple auto pointers, point to the same object. What is needed is a reference counted smart pointer that keeps a count of the number of pointers pointing to the same object.

The CONNECT module provides a generalization of this interface to connection services using a connection type and specialized connectors.</p><p>A connection is modeled by a connection type and a connector type. The connector type models the end point of the connection, and the connection type, the actual connection. Together, the connector and connection objects are used to define the following types of connections: socket, file, http, memory, and a general service connection.</p><p>The connector is described by a connector handle, CONNECTOR. CONNECTOR is a typedef and defined as a pointer to an internal data structure.</p><p>The connection is described by a connection handle CONN. CONN is a typedef and defined as a pointer to an internal structure. The CONN type is used as a parameter to a number of functions that handle the connection such as <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CONN_Create()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CONN_ReInit()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CONN_Read()</span>, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CONN_Write()</span>, etc.</p><p>The CONNECTOR socket handle is created by a call to the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">SOCK_CreateConnector()</span> function and passed the host name to connect to, the port number on the host to connect to, and maximum number of retries. The CONNECTOR handle is then passed as an argument to the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CONN_Create()</span> which returns a CONNECTION handle. The CONNECTION handle is then used with the connection functions (that have the prefix CONN_) to process the connection. The connection so created is bi-directional (full duplex) and input and output data can be processed simultaneously.</p><p>The other connector types, file, http, memory are similar to the socket connector type. In the case of a file connector, the connector handle is created by calling the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">FILE_CreateConnector()</span> function and passed an input file and an output file. This connector could be used for both reading and writing files, when input comes from one file, and output goes to another file. This differs from normal file I/O when a single handle is used to access only one file, but resembles data exchange via sockets, instead. In the case of the HTTP connection, the <span class="nctnt ncbi-type">HTTP_CreateConnector</span> type is called and passed a pointer to network information structure, a pointer to a user-header consisting of HTTP tag-values, and a bitmask representing flags that affect the HTTP response.</p><p>The general service connector is the most complex connector in the library, and can model any type of service. It can be used for data transfer between an application and a named service. The data can be sent via HTTP or directly as a byte stream (using SOCK directly). In the former case it uses the HTTP connectors and in the latter the SOCK connectors. The general service connector is used when the other connector types are not adequate for implementing the task on hand.</p><p>More details on <a href="ch_conn.html#ch_conn.socket_connector">connector classes</a> are presented in a later chapter.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_streams"><h3><span class="title">Connection Streams</span></h3><p>The CONNECT module provides a higher level of abstraction to connection programming in the form of C++ connection stream classes derived from the standard iostream class.

More specifically, the CTOOL module provides a number of useful functions such as a bridge between the NCBI C++ Toolkit and the older C Toolkit for error handling, an ASN.1 connections stream that builds on top of the <a href="ch_intro.html#ch_intro.intro_connector">connection stream</a>, and an ASN converter that provides templates for converting ASN.1-based objects between NCBI's C and C++ in-memory layouts.</p><p>The ASN.1 connections support is provides through functions <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CreateAsnConn()</span> for creating an ASN stream connection; <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CreateAsnConn_ServiceEx()</span> for creating a service connection using the service name, type and connection parameters; and <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CreateAsnConn_Service()</span> which is a specialized case of <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CreateAsnConn_ServiceEx()</span> with some parameters set to zero.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_dbapi"><h2><span class="title">The DBAPI Module</span></h2><p>The DBAPI module supports object oriented access to databases by providing user classes that model a database as a data source to which a connection can be made, and on which ordinary SQL queries or stored procedure SQL queries can be issued. The results obtained can be navigated using a result class or using the 'cursor' mechanism that is common to many databases.</p><p>The user classes are used by a programmer to access the database. The user classes depend upon a database driver to allow low level access to the underlying relational database management system (RDBMS). Each type of RDBMS can be expected to have a different driver that provides this low level hook into the database. The database drivers are architected to provide a uniform interface to the user classes so that the database driver can be changed to connect to a different database without affecting the program code that makes use of the user classes. For a list of the database drivers for different database that are supported, see the <a href="ch_dbapi.html#ch_dbapi.dbapi_drivers">Supported DBAPI Drivers section</a>.</p><p>The following is a list of topics presented in this section:</p><ul><li><p><a href="ch_intro.html#ch_intro.intro_dbapi_user">Database User Classes</a></p></li><li><p><a href="ch_intro.html#ch_intro.intro_dbapi_driver">Database Driver Architecture</a></p></li></ul><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_dbapi_user"><h3><span class="title">Database User Classes</span></h3><p>The interface to the database is provided by a number of C++ classes such as the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">IDataSource, IDbConnection, IStatement, ICallableStatement, ICursor, IResultSet, IResultSetMetaData</span> . The user does not use these interfaces directly. Instead, the DBAPI module provides concrete classes that implement these interface classes. The corresponding concrete classes for the above mentioned interfaces are <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDataSource, CDbConnection, CStatement, CCallableStatement, CCursor, CResultSet, CResultSetMetaData</span>.</p><p>Before accessing to a specific database, the user must register the driver with the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDriverManager</span> class which maintains the drivers registered for the application. The user does this by using the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDriverManager</span> class' factory method <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">GetInstance()</span> to create an instance of the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDriverManager</span> class and registering the driver with this driver manager object. For details on how this can be done, see the <a href="ch_dbapi.html#ch_dbapi.dbapi_choose_driver">Choosing the Driver</a> section.</p><p>After the driver has been registered, the user classes can be used to access that database. There are a number of ways this can be done, but the most common method is to call the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">IDataSource</span> factory method <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CreateDs()</span> to create an instance of the data source. Next, the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CreateConnection()</span> method for the data source is called, to return a connection object that implements the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">IConnection</span> interface. Next, the connection object's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Connect()</span> method is called with the user name, password, server name, database name to make the connection to the database. Next, the connection object's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CreateStatement()</span> method is called to create a statement object that implements the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">IStatement</span> interface. Next, the statement object's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Execute()</span> method is called to execute the query. Note that additional calls to the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">IConnection::CreateStatement()</span> results in cloning the connection for each statement which means that these connections inherit the database which was specified in the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Connect()</span> or <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">SetDatabase()</span> method.</p><p>Executing the statement objects' <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Execute()</span> method returns the result set which is stored in the statement object and can be accessed using the statement object's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">GetResultSet()</span> method. You can then call the statement object's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">HasRows()</span> method which returns a Boolean true if there are rows to be processed. The type of the result can be obtained by calling the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">IResultSet::GetResultType() method</span>. The <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">IStatement::ExecuteUpdate()</span> method is used for SQL statements that do not return rows (UPDATE or DELETE SQL statement), in which case the method <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">IStatement::GetRowCount()</span> returns the number of updated or deleted rows.</p><p>Calling the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">IStatement::GetResultSet()</span> returns the rows via the result set object that implements the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">IResultSet</span> interface. The method <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">IResultSet::Next()</span> is used to fetch each row in the result set and returns a false when no more fetch data is available; otherwise, it returns a true. All column data, except BLOB data is represented by a <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CVariant</span> object. The method <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">IResultSet::GetVariant()</span> takes the column number as its parameter where the first column has the start value of 1.</p><p>The <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CVariant</span> class is used to describe the fields of a record which can be of any data type. The <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CVariant</span> has a set of accessory methods (<span class="nctnt ncbi-func">GetXXX()</span>) to extract a value of a particular type. For example, the <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">GetInt4(), GetByte(), GetString()</span>, methods will extract an Int4, Byte data value from the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CVariant</span> object. If data extraction is not possible because of incompatible types, the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CVariantException</span> is thrown. The <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CVariant</span> has a set of factory methods for creating objects of a particular data type, such as <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CVariant::BigInt()</span> for Int8, <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">CVariant::SmallDateTime()</span> for NCBI's <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CTime</span>, and so on.</p><p>For sample code illustrating the above mentioned steps, see the <a href="ch_dbapi.html#ch_dbapi.dbapi_src_cnxns">Data Source and Connections</a> and <a href="ch_dbapi.html#ch_dbapi.dbapi_main_loop">Main Loop</a> sections.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_dbapi_driver"><h3><span class="title">Database Driver Architecture</span></h3><p>The driver can use two different methods to access the particular RDBMS. If RDBMS provides a client library (<span class="nctnt ncbi-lib">CTLib</span>) for a given computer system, then the driver utilizes this library. If there is no client library, then the driver connects to RDBMS through a special gateway server which is running on a computer system where such library does exist.</p><p>The database driver architecture has two major groups of the driver's objects: the RDBMS independent objects, and the RDBMS dependent objects specific to a RDBMS. From a user's perspective, the most important RDBMS dependent object is the driver context object. A connection to the database is made by calling the driver context's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Connect()</span> method. All driver contexts implement the same interface defined in the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">I_DriverContext</span> class.</p><p>If the application needs to connect to RDBMS libraries from different vendors, there is a problem trying to link statically with the RDBMS libraries from different vendors. The reason for this is that most of these libraries are written in C, and may use the same names which cause name collisions. Therefore, the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">C_DriverMgr</span> is used to overcome this problem and allow the creation of a mixture of statically linked and dynamically loaded drivers and use them together in one executable.</p><p>The low level connection to an RDBMS is specific to that RDBMS. To provide RDBMS independence, the connection information is wrapped in an RDBMS independent object <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDB_Connection</span>. The commands and the results are also wrapped in an RDBMS independent object. The user is responsible for deleting these RDBMS independent objects because the life spans of the RDBMS dependent and RDBMS independent objects are not necessarily the same.</p><p>Once you have the <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDB_Connection</span> object, you can use it as a factory for the different types of command objects. The command object's <span class="nctnt ncbi-func">Result()</span> method can be called to get the results. To send and to receive the data through the driver you must use the driver provided datatypes such as <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDB_BigInt, CDB_Float, CDB_SmallDateTime</span>. These driver data types are all derived from <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDB_Object</span> class.</p><p>More <a href="ch_dbapi.html#ch_dbapi.dbapi_driver_ref">details on the database driver architecture</a> is presented in a later chapter.</p></div></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_gui"><h2><span class="title">The GUI Module</span></h2><p>The C++ Toolkit does not include its own GUI Module.

It makes it possible to transparently download data from the GenBank database, investigate biological sequence data structure, retrieve sequence data, descriptions and annotations.</p><p>The Object Manager has been designed to present an interface to users and to minimize their exposure to the details of interacting with biological databases and their underlying data structures. The Object Manager, therefore, coordinates the use of biological sequence data objects, particularly the management of the details of loading data from different data sources.</p><p>The NCBI databases and software tools are designed around a particular model of biological sequence data. The data model must be very flexible because the nature of this data is not yet fully understood, and its fundamental properties and relationships are constantly being revised. NCBI uses <a href="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a> (ASN.1) as a formal language to describe <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/INDEX.HTML">biological sequence data and its associated information</a>.</p><p>The bio sequence data may be huge and downloading all of this data may not be practical or desirable. Therefore, the Object Manager transparently transmits only the data that is really needed and not all of it at once. There is a <a href="ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool">datatool</a> that generates corresponding data objects (source code and header files) from the object's ASN.1 specification. The Object Manager is able to manipulate these objects.</p><p>Biological sequences are identified by a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQLOC.HTML">Seq_id</a>, which may have different forms.</p><p>The most general container object of bio sequence data, as defined in NCBI data model, is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQSET.HTML">Seq_entry</a>. A great deal of NCBI software is designed to accept a Seq_entry as the primary unit of data. In general, the Seq_entry is defined recursively as a tree of Seq_entry objects, where each node contains either <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/BIOSEQ.HTML">Bioseq</a> or list of other Seq_entry objects and additional data like sequence description, sequence annotations.</p><p>Two important concepts in the Object Manager are <span class="nctnt ncbi-monospace">scope</span> and <span class="nctnt ncbi-monospace">reference resolution</span>. The client defines a scope as the sources of data where the system uses only "allowed" sources to look for data. Scopes may contain several variants of the same bio sequence (Seq_entry). Since sequences refer to each other, the scope sets may have some data that is common to both scopes. In this case changing data in one scope should be reflected in all other scopes, which "look" at the same data.</p><p>The other concept a client uses is <span class="nctnt ncbi-monospace">reference resolution</span>. Reference resolution is used in situations where different biological sequences can refer to each other. For example, a sequence of amino acids may be the same as sequence of amino acids in another sequence. The data retrieval system should be able to resolve such references automatically answering what amino acids are actually here. Optionally, at the client's request, such automatic resolution may be turned off.</p><p>The Object Manager provides a consistent view of the data despite modifications to the data. For example, the data may change during a client's session because new biological data has been uploaded to the database while the client is still processing the old data. In this case, when the client for additional data, the system should retrieve the original bio sequence data, and not the most recent one. However, if the database changes between a client's sessions, then the next time the client session is started, the most recent data is retrieved, unless the client specifically asks for the older data.</p><p>The Object Manager is thread safe, and supports multithreading which makes it possible to work with bio sequence data from multiple threads.</p><p>The Object Manager includes numerous classes for accessing bio sequence data such as <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDataLoader</span> and <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CDataSource</span> which manage global and local accesses to data, <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CSeqVector</span> and <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CSeqMap</span> objects to find and manipulate sequence data, a number of <a href="ch_objmgr.html#ch_objmgr.om_def.html_Iterators">specialized iterators</a> to parse descriptions and annotations, among others. The <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CObjectManager</span> and <span class="nctnt ncbi-class">CScope</span> classes provide the foundation of the library, managing data objects and coordinating their interactions.</p><p>More <a href="ch_objmgr.html">details on the Object Manager and related classes</a> is presented in a later chapter.</p></div><div class="sec" id="ch_intro.intro_ser"><h2><span class="title">The SERIAL Module</span></h2><p>Click here to see <a href="ch_ser.html">Full Documentation on the Data Serialization Library</a>.</p><p>Serial library provides means for loading, accessing, manipulating, and serialization of data in a formatted way. It supports serialization in <a href="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr">ASN.1</a> (text or BER encoding), <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML">XML</a>, and <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a> formats.</p><p>The structure of data is described by some sort of formal language. In our case it can be ASN.1, DTD or XML Schema. Based on such specification, <a href="ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool">DATATOOL</a> application, which is part of NCBI C++ toolkit, generates a collection of data storage classes that can be used to store and serialize data. The design purpose was to make these classes as lightweight as possible, moving all details of serialization into specialized classes - <a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.objstream.html_intro">“object streams”</a>. Structure of the data is described with the help of <a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.typeinfo.html">“type information”</a>. Data objects contain data and type information only. Any such data storage object can be viewed as a node tree that provides random access to its data. Serial library provides means to<a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_cobjinfo"> traversing</a> this data tree without knowing its structure in advance – using only type information; C++ code generated by DATATOOL makes it possible to access any child node directly.</p><p><a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.objstream.html_intro">“Object streams”</a> are intermediaries between data storage objects and input or output stream. They perform encoding or decoding of data according to format specifications. Guided by the type information embedded into data object, on reading they allocate memory when needed, fill in data, and validate that all mandatory data is present; on writing they guarantee that all relevant data is written and that the resulting document is well-formed. All it takes to read or write a top-level data object is one function call – all the details are handled by an object stream.</p><p>Closely related to serialization is the task of converting data from one format into another. One approach could be reading data object completely into memory and then writing it in another format. The only problem is that the size of data can be huge. To simplify this task and to avoid storing data in memory, serial library provides <a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.objstream.html_objcopy">“object stream copier”</a> class. It reads data by small chunks and writes it immediately after reading. In addition to small memory footprint, it also works much faster.</p><p>Input data can be very large in size; also, reading it completely into memory could not be the goal of processing. Having a large file of data, one might want to investigate information containers only of a particular type. Serial library provides a variety of means for doing this. The list includes <a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.objstream.html_readhooks">read</a> and <a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.objstream.html_writehooks">write</a> hooks, several types of <a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.stream_iterators">stream iterators</a>, and <a href="ch_ser.html#ch_ser.serial_filter">filter templates</a>. It is worth to note that, when using read hooks to read child nodes, one might end up with an invalid top-level data object; or, when using write hooks, one might begin with an invalid object and fill in missing data on the fly – in hooks.</p><p>In essence, “hook” is a callback function that client application provides to serial library. Client application installs the hook, then reads (or writes) data object, and somewhere from the depths of serialization processing, the library calls this hook function at appropriate times, for example, when a data chunk of specified type is about to be read.
