    <h1>Internal Resource Unavailable Outside NCBI</h1>
    <h2>The URL you have accessed is only available for users within NCBI.</h2>
    <h3>What happened:</h3>
    <p>You have clicked on a link that is only available from within NCBI.</p>
    <p>Because the great majority of the NCBI C++ Toolkit book is applicable
        whether you are inside or outside of NCBI, it would be very inefficient
        to maintain separate NCBI-internal and public versions. Therefore,
        some NCBI-internal content is visible outside NCBI.</p>
    <h3>What to do:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For your future reference, please note that this particular
            resource is only available from within NCBI.</li>
        <li>Press the Back button on your browser to return to the
            previous page.</li>
    </ol>
