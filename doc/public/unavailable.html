    <h1>Internal Resource Unavailable Outside NCBI</h1>
    <h2>What happened:</h2>
    <p>The last page you were viewing contains a reference to an internal
        resource. For users inside NCBI, the reference is a hyperlink. For
        users outside NCBI, the reference is just bracketed text, with an
        asterisk that links to this page.</p>
    <h2>An explanation:</h2>
    <p>Because the great majority of the NCBI C++ Toolkit book is applicable
        whether you are inside or outside of NCBI, it would be very inefficient
        to maintain separate NCBI-internal and public versions. However, if we
        published web pages with links to internal content, those pages would
        contain broken links for users outside NCBI. Therefore, for outside
        users, we simply replace all internal links with bracketed text and a
        link to this page.</p>
    <h2>What to do:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For your future reference, please note that the resource is only
            available from within NCBI.</li>
        <li>Press the Back button on your browser to return to the
            previous page.</li>
