<h3>Using threads</h3>

<p>
<i><b>CThread</i></b> class is defined in
<i><b>include/corelib/ncbithr.hpp</b></i>.
The <i><b>CThread</i></b> class provides all basic thread
functionality: thread creation, launching,
termination, and cleanup. To create user-defined
thread one needs only to provide the thread's
<i><b>Main()</b></i> function and, in some cases,
create a new constructor to transfer data to the
thread object, and override <i><b>OnExit()</b></i>
method for thread-specific data cleanup. To
create a custom thread:
<p>

<ol>
<li>Derive your class from <i><b>CThread</i></b>, override
<i><b>Main()</b></i> and, if necessary, <i><b>OnExit()</b></i>
methods.
<li>Create thread object in your application.
You can do this only with <tt>new</tt> operator,
since static or in-stack thread objects are prohibited
(see below). The best way to reference thread objects
is to use <i><b>CRef&lt;CThread&gt;</i></b> class.
<li>Call <i><b>Run()</b></i> to start the thread execution.
<li>Call <i><b>Detach()</b></i> to let the thread
run independently (it will destroy itself on termination then),
or use <i><b>Join()</b></i> to wait for the thread termination.
</ol>
<p>

The code should look like:
<p>

<pre><font color="#008080">
#include &lt;corelib/ncbistd.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;corelib/ncbithr.hpp&gt;

USING_NCBI_SCOPE;

class CMyThread : public CThread
{
public:
    CMyThread(int index) : m_Index(index) {}
    virtual void* Main(void);
    virtual void OnExit(void);
private:
    int m_Index;
    int* heap_var;
};


void* CMyThread::Main(void)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Thread " &lt;&lt; m_Index &lt;&lt; endl;

    heap_var = new int; // to be destroyed by OnExit()
    *heap_var = 12345;

    int* return_value = new int; // return to the main thread
    *return_value = m_Index;
    return return_value;
}

void CMyThread::OnExit(void)
{
    delete heap_var;
}

int main(void)
{
    CMyThread* thread = new CMyThread(33);
    thread-&gt;Run();
    int* result;
    thread-&gt;Join(reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&result));
    cout &lt;&lt; "Returned value: " &lt;&lt; *result &lt;&lt; endl;
    delete result;
    return 0;
}

</font></pre>
<p>

The above simple application will start one child thread,
passing 33 as the <tt>index</tt> value.
The thread prints "Thread 33" message, allocates and
initializes two integer variables, and terminates.
The thread's <i><b>Main()</i></b> function returns a pointer
to one of the allocated values. This pointer is then passed to
<i><b>Join()</b></i> method and can be used by another thread.
the other integer allocated by <i><b>Main()</i></b> is
destroyed by <i><b>OnExit()</i></b> method.
<p>

It is important not to terminate the program until there are
running threads. Program termination will cause all the running
threads to terminate also. In the above example <i><b>Join()</i></b>
function is used to wait for the child thread termination.

<a name=cthreadpublic></a>
<h4><a href=../lxr/ident?i=CThread>CThread</a>
class public methods</h4>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><i><b>CThread(void)</b></i>
<dd>Create the thread object (without running it).

<dt><i><b>bool Run(void)</b></i>
<dd>Spawn the new thread, initialize internal <i><b>CThread</i></b> data
and launch user-provided <i><b>Main()</i></b>. The method
guarantees that the new thread will start before it returns
to the calling function.

<dt><i><b>void Detach(void)</b></i>
<dd>Inform the thread that user does not need to wait for
its termination. Detached thread will
destroy itself after termination. If Detach() is called for
a thread, which has already terminated, it will be scheduled
for destruction immediately. Only one call to <i><b>Detach()</i></b>
is allowed for each thread object.

<dt><i><b>void Join(void** exit_data)</b></i>
<dd>Wait for the thread termination. <i><b>Join()</i></b> will store the
<tt>void</tt> pointer as returned by the user's <i><b>Main()</i></b>
method, or passed to the <i><b>Exit()</i></b> function to the
<tt>exit_data</tt>. Then the thread will be scheduled for destruction.
Only one call to <i><b>Join()</i></b> is allowed for each
thread object. If called more than once, <i><b>Join()</i></b> will
cause a runtime error.

<dt><i><b>static void Exit(void* exit_data)</b></i>
<dd>This function may be called by a thread object itself
to terminate the thread. The thread will be terminated
and, if already detached, scheduled for destruction.
<tt>exit_data</tt> value is transferred to the <i><b>Join()</i></b>
function as if it was returned by the <i><b>Main()</i></b>.
<i><b>Exit()</i></b> will also call virtual method
<i><b>OnExit()</b></i> to execute user-provided cleanup code (if any).

<dt><i><b>bool Discard(void)</b></i>
<dd>Schedules the thread object for destruction if it
has not been run yet. This function is provided since
there is no other way to delete a thread object without
running it. On success, return <tt>true</tt>.
If the thread has already been run, <i><b>Discard()</i></b> do
nothing and return <tt>false</tt>.

<dt><i><b>static CThread::TID GetSelf(void)</b></i>
<dd>This method returns a unique thread ID. This ID may
be then used to identify threads, for example, to track the
owner of a shared resource. Since the  main thread
has no associated <i><b>CThread</i></b> object, a special value of 0
(zero) is reserved for the main thread ID.

</dl>
<p>



<a name=cthreadprotected></a>
<h4><a href=../lxr/ident?i=CThread>CThread</a> class protected methods</h4>
<p>

<dl>
<dt><i><b>virtual void* Main(void)</b></i>
<dd><i><b>Main()</i></b> is the thread's main function
(just like an application <i><b>main()</i></b> function).
This method is not defined in the <i><b>CThread</i></b> class.
It must be provided by derived user-defined class. The return
value is passed to the <i><b>Join()</i></b> function (and thus
may be used by another thread for some sort of inter-thread
communication).

<dt><i><b>virtual void OnExit(void)</b></i>
<dd>This method is called (in the context of the thread) just before
the thread termination to cleanup thread-specific resources.
<i><b>OnExit()</i></b> is NOT called by <i><b>Discard()</i></b>, since the thread
has not been run in this case and there are no thread-specific
data to destroy.

<dt><i><b>virtual ~CThread(void)</b></i>
<dd>The destructor is protected to avoid
thread object premature destruction. For this reason,
no thread object can be static or stack-allocated.
It is important to declare any <i><b>CThread</i></b>-derived
class destructor as <tt>protected</tt>.

<p>

The diagram demonstrates that thread constructors called from the parent
thread. The child thread is spawned by the <i><b>Run()</i></b> function only.
Then, the user-provided <i><b>Main()</i></b> method (containing code created
by user) gets executed. The thread's destructor may be called in the
context of either parent or child thread depending on the state of the thread
at the moment when <i><b>Join()</i></b> or <i><b>Detach()</i></b> is called.
<p>

There are two possible ways to terminate a thread. By default,
after user-provided <i><b>Main()</i></b> function return, the <i><b>Exit()</i></b> is called
implicitly to terminate the thread. User functions can call
<i><b>CThread::Exit()</i></b> directly. Since <i><b>Exit()</i></b> is a static method,
the calling function does not need to be a thread class member or
have a reference to the thread object. <i><b>Exit()</b></i> will terminate
the thread in which context it is called.
<p>

The <i><b>CThread</i></b> destructor is <tt>protected</tt>. The same
must be true for any user-defined thread class in order to prohibit
creation of static or automatic thread objects. For the same reason,
a thread object can not be destroyed by explicit <tt>delete</tt>.
All threads destroy themselves on termination, detaching,
or joining.
<p>

On thread termination, <i><b>Exit()</i></b> checks if the thread has been detached
and, if this is true, destroys the thread object. If the thread
has not been detached, the thread object will remain "zombie"
unless detached or joined. Either <i><b>Detach()</i></b> or <i><b>Join()</i></b> will
destroy the object if the thread has been terminated. One should
keep in mind, that it is not safe to use the thread object
after a call to <i><b>Join()</i></b> or <i><b>Detach()</i></b> since the object may happen
to be destroyed. To avoid this situation, the <i><b>CRef&lt;CThread&gt;</i></b> can
be used. The thread object will not be destroyed until there is
at least one <i><b>CRef</i></b> to the object (although it may be terminated
and scheduled for destruction).
<p>

In other words, a thread object will be destroyed when all
of the following conditions are satisfied:
<p>

<ul>
<li>the thread has been run and terminated by an implicit or
explicit call to <i><b>Exit()</i></b>
<li>the thread has been detached or joined
<li>no <i><b>CRef</i></b> references the thread object
</ul>
<p>

Which thread will actually destroy a thread object depends on several
conditions. If the thread has been detached before termination,
the <i><b>Exit()</i></b> method will destroy it, provided there
are no <i><b>CRef</i></b> references to the object. When joined, the thread
will be destroyed in the context of a joining thread. If
<i><b>Detach()</i></b> is called after thread termination, it will destroy
the thread in the context of detaching thread. And, finally,
if there are several <i><b>CRef</i></b> objects referencing the same thread,
it will be destroyed after the last <i><b>CRef</i></b> release.
<p>

This means that cleaning up thread-specific data can not be
done from the thread destructor. One should override <i><b>OnExit()</i></b>
method instead. <i><b>OnExit()</i></b> is guaranteed to be called in the
context of the thread before the thread termination. The destructor
can be used to cleanup non-thread-local data only.
<p>

There is one more possibility to destroy a thread. If a thread has been
created, but does not need to be run, one can use
<i><b>Discard()</i></b> method to destroy the thread object without
running it. Again, the object will not be destroyed until there
are <i><b>CRef</i></b>s referencing it.
<p>


<a name=threadref></a>
<h4>Referencing thread objects</h4>
<p>

It should be emphasized that regular (C) pointer to a thread object
is not reliable. The thread may terminate at unpredictable
moment, destroying itself. There is no possibility to safely
access thread object after <i><b>Join()</b></i> using C pointers. The only
solution to this problem is to use <i><b>CRef</i></b> class. <i><b>CThread</i></b>
class provides a mechanism to prevent premature destruction
if there are <i><b>CRef</i></b> references to the thread object.

<a name=synchronization></a>
<h3>Synchronization</h3>

The following classes implement threads synchronization mechanisms:
<p>

<ul>
<li><i><b>CFastMutex, CFastMutexGuard</b></i>
<li><i><b>CMutex, CAutoMutex, CMutexGuard</b></i>
<li><i><b>CRWLock, CAutoRW, CReadLockGuard, CWriteLockGuard</b></i>
</ul>
<p>



<a name=cfastmutex></a>
<h4><a href=../lxr/ident?i=CFastMutex>CFastMutex</a>,
<a href=../lxr/ident?i=CFastMutexGuard>CFastMutexGuard</a></h4>
<p>

<i><b>CFastMutex</i></b> class is defined in
<a href=../lxr/source/include/corelib/ncbimtx.hpp><i>include/corelib/ncbimtx.hpp</i></a>.
This class implements basic mutex behavior with minimum performance overheads.
<i><b>Lock()</i></b> and <i><b>Unlock()</i></b>
methods will acquire and release the mutex
for the calling thread. No checks of nesting or unlocking of a
non-acquired mutex are performed. For this reason, <i><b>CFastMutex</i></b>
should be used only to protect small and simple parts of code.
To guarantee for the mutex release the <i><b>CFastMutexGuard</i></b> class
may be used. The mutex is locked by the <i><b>CFastMutexGuard</i></b>
constructor and unlocked by its destructor. The example below demonstrates how to protect
an integer variable with the fast mutex:
<p>

<pre><font color="#008080">
void ThreadSafe(void)
{
    static int Count = 0;
    static CFastMutex CountMutex;
    ...
    {{
        CFastMutexGuard guard(CountMutex);
        Count++;
    }}
    ...
}

</font></pre>
<p>



<a name=cmutex></a>
<h4><a href=../lxr/ident?i=CMutex>CMutex</a>,
<a href=../lxr/ident?i=CAutoMutex>CAutoMutex</a>,
<a href=../lxr/ident?i=CMutexGuard>CMutexGuard</a></h4>
<p>

<i><b>CMutex</i></b> uses the functionality of <i><b>CFastMutex</i></b>.
It also allows nested locks and performs checks of mutex owner.
This makes <i><b>CMutex</i></b> somewhat slower than <i><b>CFastMutex</i></b>,
but capable of protecting complicated code, and safer to use. To guarantee
for a mutex release, <i><b>CAutoMutex</i></b> can be used. <i><b>CAutoMutex</i></b>
unlocks the associated mutex on destruction, but unlike <i><b>CFastMutexGuard</i></b>,
it does not lock the mutex when created. To both acquire a mutex and guarantee
for its release, <i><b>CMutexGuard</i></b> can be used instead.
The following example demonstrates usage of <i><b>CMutex</i></b>, including
lock nesting:
<p>

<pre><font color="#008080">
static int Count = 0;
static CMutex CountMutex;

void Add2(void)
{
    CMutexGuard guard(CountMutex);
    Count += 2;
    if (Count &lt; 20) {
        Add3();
    }
}

void Add3(void)
{
    CMutexGuard guard(CountMutex);
    Count += 3;
    if (Count &lt; 20) {
        Add2();
    }
}

</font></pre>
<p>

This example will result in several nested locks of the same mutex
with the guaranteed release of each lock.
<p>

It is important not to unlock the mutex protected by a mutex guard.
<i><b>CFastMutexGuard</i></b> and <i><b>CMutexGuard</i></b> both unlock
the associated mutex on destruction. It the mutex is already unlocked
this will cause a runtime error. Instead of unlocking the mutex directly
one can use <i><b>CFastMutexGuard::Release()</i></b> or
<i><b>CMutexGuard::Release()</i></b> method. This
methods unlock the mutex and unlink it from the guard.
<p>

In addition to usual <i><b>Lock()</i></b> and <i><b>Unlock()</i></b> methods,
the <i><b>CMutex</i></b> class implements a method to test the mutex state before
locking it. <i><b>TryLock()</i></b> method attempts to acquire the mutex
for the calling thread and returns <tt>true</tt> on success (this
includes nested locks by the same thread) or <tt>false</tt> if the
mutex has been acquired by another thread. After a successful
<i><b>TryLock()</i></b> the mutex should be unlocked like after
regular <i><b>Lock()</i></b>.
<p>


<a name=crwlock></a>
<h4><a href=../lxr/ident?i=CRWLock>CRWLock</a>,
<a href=../lxr/ident?i=CAutoRW>CAutoRW</a>,
<a href=../lxr/ident?i=CReadLockGuard>CReadLockGuard</a>,
<a href=../lxr/ident?i=CWriteLockGuard>CWriteLockGuard</a></h4>
<p>

This class implements sharing a resource between multiple
reading and writing threads. The following rules are used
for locking:
<p>

<ul>
<li>if unlocked, the RWLock can be acquired for either
R-lock or W-lock
<li>if R-locked, the RWLock can be R-locked
by the same thread or other threads
<li>if W-locked, the RWLock can not be acquired by other
threads (a call to <i><b>ReadLock()</i></b> or <i><b>WriteLock()</i></b>
by another thread will suspend that thread until the RW-lock release).
<li>R-lock after W-lock by the same thread is allowed but treated
as a nested W-lock
<li>W-lock after R-lock by the same thread results in a runtime error
</ul>
<p>

Like <i><b>CMutex</i></b>, CRWLock also provides methods for checking its current
state: <i><b>TryReadLock()</i></b> and <i><b>TryWriteLock()</i></b>.
Both methods try to acquire the RW-lock, returning <tt>true</tt>
on success (the RW-lock becomes R-locked or W-locked) or
<tt>false</tt> if the RW-lock can not be acquired for the calling thread.
<p>


<hr>
<p>


<a name=tls></a>
<h3>Thread local storage
(<a href=../lxr/ident?i=CTls>CTls&lt;&gt;</a> class)</h3>

The library provides a template class to store
thread specific data: <i><b>CTls&lt;&gt;</i></b>. This means that each
thread can keep its own data in the same TLS object.
To perform any kind of cleanup one can provide
cleanup function and additional cleanup data when
storing a value in the TLS object.
The following example demonstrates the usage of TLS:
<p>

<pre><font color="#008080">
CRef&lt; CTls&lt;int&gt; &gt; tls;

void TlsCleanup(int* p_value, void* /* data */ )
{
    delete p_value;
}

...
void* CMyThread::Main()
{
    int* p_value = new int;
    *p_value = 1;
    tls-&gt;SetValue(p_value, TlsCleanup);
    ...
    p_value = new int;
    *p_value = 2;
    tls-&gt;SetValue(p_value, TlsCleanup);
    ...
    if (*tls-&gt;GetValue() == 2) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}

</font></pre>
<p>

In the above example the second call to <i><b>SetValue()</i></b> will cause
the <i><b>TlsCleanup</i></b> to deallocate the first integer variable.
To cleanup the last value stored in each TLS, the
<i><b>CThread::Exit()</i></b> function will automatically call
<i><b>CTls&lt;&gt;::Reset()</i></b> for
each TLS used by the thread.
<p>

By default, all TLS objects are destroyed on program
termination, since in most cases it is not guaranteed that
a TLS object is not (or will not be) used by a thread.
For the same reason the <i><b>CTls&lt;&gt;</i></b> destructor is
protected, so that no TLS can be created in the stack memory. The best
way of keeping TLS objects is to use <i><b>CRef</i></b>.
<p>

Calling <i><b>Discard()</i></b> will schedule the TLS to be destroyed
as soon as there are no <i><b>CRef</i></b> references to the object left.
The method should be used with care.
