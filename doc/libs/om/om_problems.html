<h4>How to construct Seq_id by accession?</h4>
<p>
The current toolkit lacks a function that creates a proper Seq_Id from
an accession.
<br>
The accession number is actually formalized so it is possible, looking
at an accession to determine the database this accession refers to.
There is a 
<a href="http://intranet.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/DIRSUB/acc_num.html">page</a>,
which describes the relationship, but even better, there is a function in
C toolkit which does it:
<pre>
    NLM_EXTERN Uint4 LIBCALL WHICH_db_accession (CharPtr s)  // sequtil.c
</pre>
This function is called from SeqIdFromAccession (sequtil.c).
</p>
<p>
</p>
Currently, one has to specify an exact version number, otherwise
GetBioseqHandle fails. A user might not know a version number for an accession
s/he wants to retrieve, so, if version is not provided, the last version of the
accession should be fetched.
</p>

<h4>How to use SeqMap?</h4>
<p>
There are two methods in Bioseq_Handle, which return SeqMap object:
<pre>
    const CSeqMap&amp; GetSeqMap(void) const;
    const CSeqMap&amp GetResolvedSeqMap(void) const;
</pre>
What is the difference? The point is that a sequence can refer to other sequences,
which in turn to others etc. etc. <var>Object Manager</var> does not resolve this
references until a client needs it. So, the contents of SeqMap object returned by
<tt>GetSeqMap</tt> depends on a history of previous calls. From the other side,
<tt>GetResolvedSeqMap</tt> returns completely resolved map, that is map, which
does not contain references to references, nor references to gaps - only either data,
or references to data, or gaps.

<h4>Other suggestions.</h4>

  <li>
    CSeq_loc needs an additional function - to make its complement.
  </li>
  <li>
    CBioseq needs an additional function - one that has been called
    <tt>GetBestId</tt> in the old toolkit (the best id is actually 'GI').
	If there is no GI there are priorities defined in the old toolkit.
    The construction <tt>GetId().begin()</tt>, one has to use instead,
	is not quite proper.
  </li>
</ol>
