All new changes are being made to the Toolkit Book
at the following locations:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Official Release:</i> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">
    C++ Toolkit Book</a>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Development Version:</i> <a href="http://xpubmed0.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:5701/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">

    C++ Toolkit Book (no search engine, accessible from inside NCBI only)</a>. </li> </ul> The Development Version is the most recent documentation before it becomes an Official Release. While the Development Version is the lastest version, it is accessible only from inside NCBI, and the search engine functionality is currently missing. Also, the location of the Development Version may change without warning! So it is suggested that you use the Official Release, and use the Development Version only when necessary.</p> </i>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>
Client must be able to analyze biological sequence data, which come from
multiple heterogeneous data sources. As for &quot;standard&quot; databases, we mean
only NCBI GenBank. &quot;Nonstandard&quot; data source may include but are not limited
to reading data from file or constructing bio sequence &quot;manually&quot;.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of biologist could be to investigate different combinations
of data pieces. The system should provide for transparent merge of different
pieces of data, as well as various combinations of it. Important thing
to note is that such combinations may be incorrect or ambiguous. It is
one of  the possible goals of client to discover such ambiguity.
</p>

<p>
The bio sequence data may be huge. Querying this vast amount of data
from a remote database may impose severe requirements on communication
lines and computer resources &#8211; both client and server. The system should
provide for partial data acquisition. In other words, the system should
only transmit data that is really needed, not all of it at once. At the
same time this technology should not impose additional (or too much) restrictions
on a client system. The process, from a client point of view, should be
as transparent as possible. When and if client needs more information, it
should be retrieved  &quot;automatically&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Different biological sequences can refer to each other. One example
of such reference may be in the form "the sequence of amino acids here is
the same as sequence of amino acids there" (what is the meaning of here
and there is a separate question). The data retrieval system should be able
to resolve  such references automatically answering what amino acids (or
nucleic acids) are actually here.  At the same time, at client request, such
automatic resolution may be turned  off. Probably, the client&#8217;s purpose is
to investigate such references.
</p>

<p>
Biological sequences are identified by
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQLOC.HTML">Seq_id</a>,
which may have different forms. Information about specific sequence
stored  in the database  can be modified at any time. Sometimes, if changes
are minor,  this only results  in creating a new submission of existing bio
sequence and assigning a new  revision number to it. In case of more substantial
changes  new version number  can be assigned. The data change, still, from
client point of view the system  should provide consistency. Possible scenarios
include:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Database changes during client&#8217;s session. Client starts  working
and retrieves some data from the database, the data in database then  change.
When client then asks for an additional data, the system should retrieve
original bio sequence submission data, not the most recent one.
</li>

<li>Database changes between client&#8217;s sessions. Client retrieves   some
data and ends work session. Next time the most recent submission data   is
retrieved, unless the client asks for a specific version number.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The system must support multithreading. It should be possible to work
with  bio sequence data from multiple threads.
