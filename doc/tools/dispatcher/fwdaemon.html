<h1>NCBI Firewall Daemon (<span class="ncbi_app">FWDaemon</span>)</h1>

So-called "NCBI Firewall Daemon" (FD) is essentially a network
multiplexer listening at an advertised network address.

<p>
FD works in a close cooperation with the <a href="DISPD.html">NCBI network
dispatcher</a>, which informs FD on how to connect to the "real" NCBI server, and then instructs
the network client to connect to FD (instead of the "real" NCBI server).
Thus, FD serves as a middleman that just pumps the network traffic
from the network client to the NCBI server and back.

<p>
FD allows network client to establish a persistent TCP/IP connection
to any of publicly advertised NCBI services, provided that the client
is allowed to make outgoing network connection to any of the following
FD addresses (on front-end NCBI machines):
<blockquote><pre class="ncbi_code">
130.14.29.112, ports 5860..5870
</pre>
</blockquote>

<span class="ncbi_note">NOTE</span>: One FD can simultaneously serve many client/server pairs.

<p><br>
<h2>Using FD to connect from behind a "regular" firewall</h2>


If your network client is behind a regular firewall, then just
ask your system administrator to open the above addresses (only!) for outgoing
connections, then set your client to "firewall" mode... and that's it, now
your network client can use NCBI network services in a usual way
(as if there were no firewall at all).


<p><br>
<h2>Using FD to connect from behind a "non-transparent" firewall</h2>

<span class="ncbi_note">NOTE</span>:  If your firewall is "non-transparent" (it is extremely rare case),
then your system administrator must "map" the corresponding ports on
your firewall server to the advertised FD addresses (shown above).
In this case, you will have to specify the address of your firewall server
in the client configuration (<a href="../../libs/conn.html#ref_ProxyHost">CONN_PROXY_HOST</a>).

<p>
The mapping on your non-transparent firewall server should look like this:
<blockquote><pre class="ncbi_code">
CONN_PROXY_HOST:5860..5870    --&gt;    130.14.29.112:5860..5870
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Please not that there is a port range that might not be presently
used by any clients and servers, but is reserved for future extensions.
Nevertheless, we recommend that you have this range configured on firewalls
already now to allow the applications to function seamlessly in the future.


<p><br>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

You can test if the FD ports are accessible from your host by just running,
for example:

<blockquote><pre class="ncbi_cmd">
telnet 130.14.29.112 5861
</pre>
</blockquote>

and entering a line of arbitrary text in the TELNET session.
If everything is fine, your TELNET session will look as follows
(the line "test" is your input here):

<blockquote><pre class="ncbi_cmd">
&gt; telnet 130.14.29.112 5861
Trying 130.14.29.112...
Connected to 130.14.29.112.
Escape character is '^]'.

</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
There is also an auxiliary UNIX shell script
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cpp/network/fwd_check.sh" class="ncbi_script">fwd_check.sh</a>
to check the <span class="ncbi_term">accessibility</span> of all of the above FD addresses.

<p>
The following dynamic <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cpp/network/fwd_check.cgi">Web page</a>
checks whether the FD is <em>running</em> on all hosts mentioned above.
