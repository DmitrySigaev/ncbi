<center><h1>NCBI Firewall Daemon (FWDaemon)</h1></center>

So-called "NCBI Firewall Daemon" (FD) is essentially a network
multiplexer listening at an advertised network address.

<p>
FD works in a close cooperation with the <a href="DISPD.html">NCBI network
dispatcher</a>, which informs FD on how to connect to the "real" NCBI server, and then instructs
the network client to connect to FD (instead of the "real" NCBI server).
Thus, FD serves as a middleman that just pumps the network traffic
from the network client to the NCBI server and back.

<p>
FD allows network client to establish a persistent TCP/IP connection
to any of publicly advertised NCBI services, provided that the client
is allowed to make outgoing network connection to any of the following
FD addresses (on front-end NCBI machines):

<pre>
   130.14.22.1,  port 5853
   130.14.22.2,  port 5859
   130.14.22.8,  port 5840
   130.14.22.30, port 5810
   130.14.22.31, port 5812
   130.14.22.32, port 5811
</pre>

NOTE: One FD can simultaneously serve many client/server pairs.


<h2>Using FD to connect from behind a "regular" firewall</h2>


If your network client is behind a regular firewall, then just
ask your system administrator to open the above addresses (only!) for outgoing
connections, then set your client to "firewall" mode... and that's it, now
your network client can use NCBI network services in a usual way
(as if there were no firewall at all).



<h2>Using FD to connect from behind a "non-transparent" firewall</h2>

NOTE:  If your firewall is "non-transparent" (it is extremely rare case),
then your system administrator must "map" the corresponding ports on
your firewall server to the advertised FD addresses (shown above).
In this case, you will have to specify the address of your firewall server
in the client configuration (<a href="../../libs/conn.html#ref_ProxyHost">CONN_PROXY_HOST</a>).

<p>
The mapping on your non-transparent firewall server should look like this:

<pre>
 CONN_PROXY_HOST:5853    --&gt;    130.14.22.1:5853
 CONN_PROXY_HOST:5859    --&gt;    130.14.22.2:5859
 CONN_PROXY_HOST:5840    --&gt;    130.14.22.8:5840
 CONN_PROXY_HOST:5810    --&gt;    130.14.22.30:5810
 CONN_PROXY_HOST:5812    --&gt;    130.14.22.31:5812
 CONN_PROXY_HOST:5811    --&gt;    130.14.22.32:5811
</pre>


<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

You can test if the FD ports are accessible from your host by just running,
for example:

<pre>
  telnet 130.14.22.1 5853
</pre>

and entering a line of arbitrary text in the TELNET session.
If everything is fine, your TELNET session will look as follows
(the line "test" is your input here):

<pre>
&gt; telnet 130.14.22.1 5853
Trying 130.14.22.1...
Connected to 130.14.22.1.
Escape character is '^]'.

<p>
There is also an auxiliary UNIX shell script
`<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cpp/network/fwd_check.sh">fwd_check.sh</a>'
(and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cpp/network/fwd_check.cgi">Web page</a>)
to check the accessibility of all of the above FD addresses.
