// CThreadedServer - abstract class for network servers using thread pools.
//   This code maintains a pool of threads (initially m_InitThreads, but
//   potentially as many as m_MaxThreads) to deal with incoming connections;
//   each connection gets assigned to one of the worker threads, allowing
//   the server to handle multiple requests in parallel while still checking
//   for new requests.
//
//   You must define Process() to indicate what to do with each incoming
//   connection; .../src/connect/test_threaded_server.cpp illustrates
//   how you might do this.
