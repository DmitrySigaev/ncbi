 * File Description:
 *   Memory-resident FIFO storage area (to be used e.g. in I/O buffering)
 *
 * Handle:  BUF
 *
 * Functions:
 *   BUF_SetChunkSize
 *   BUF_Size
 *   BUF_Write
 *   BUF_PushBack
 *   BUF_Peek
 *   BUF_PeekAt
 *   BUF_Read
 *   BUF_Destroy

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * $Log$
 * Revision 6.5  2001/04/23 22:20:26  vakatov
 * BUF_PeekAt() -- special case for "data" == NULL
 *
 * Revision 6.4  2001/04/23 18:07:19  vakatov
 * + BUF_PeekAt()
 *
 * Revision 6.3  2000/02/23 22:33:37  vakatov
 * Can work both "standalone" and as a part of NCBI C++ or C toolkits
 *
 * Revision 6.2  1999/10/12 16:30:10  vakatov
 * include <string.h> to define "size_t"
 *
 * Revision 6.1  1999/08/17 19:45:22  vakatov
 * Moved all real code from NCBIBUF to NCBI_BUFFER;  the code has been cleaned
 * from the NCBI C toolkit specific types and API calls.
 * NCBIBUF module still exists for the backward compatibility -- it
 * provides old NCBI-wise interface.
