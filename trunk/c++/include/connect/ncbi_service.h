 * $Log$
 * Revision 6.4  2000/05/31 23:12:17  lavr
 * First try to assemble things together to get working service mapper
 *
 * Revision 6.3  2000/05/22 16:53:07  lavr
 * Rename service_info -> server_info everywhere (including
 * file names) as the latter name is more relevant
 *
 * Revision 6.2  2000/05/12 18:29:22  lavr
 * First working revision
