*
* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* $Log$
* Revision 1.3  2001/05/21 14:38:38  kholodov
* Added: method WriteAsString() for string representation of an object.
*
* Revision 1.2  2001/04/17 04:08:01  vakatov
* Redesigned from a pure interface (ISerializable) into a regular
* base class (CSerializable) to make its usage safer, more formal and
* less bulky.

* Revision 1.1  2001/04/12 17:01:04  kholodov
* General serializable interface for different output formats
