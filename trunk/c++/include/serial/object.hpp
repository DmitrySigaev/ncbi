* $Log$
* Revision 1.18  2001/05/17 14:57:05  lavr
* Typos corrected
*
* Revision 1.17  2000/10/20 15:51:24  vasilche
* Fixed data error processing.
* Added interface for constructing container objects directly into output stream.
* object.hpp, object.inl and object.cpp were split to
* objectinfo.*, objecttype.*, objectiter.* and objectio.*.
*
* Revision 1.16  2000/10/03 17:22:33  vasilche
* Reduced header dependency.
* Reduced size of debug libraries on WorkShop by 3 times.
* Fixed tag allocation for parent classes.
* Fixed CObject allocation/deallocation in streams.
* Moved instantiation of several templates in separate source file.
*
* Revision 1.15  2000/09/26 19:24:53  vasilche
* Added user interface for setting read/write/copy hooks.
*
* Revision 1.14  2000/09/26 17:38:07  vasilche
* Fixed incomplete choiceptr implementation.
* Removed temporary comments.
*
* Revision 1.13  2000/09/18 20:00:04  vasilche
* Separated CVariantInfo and CMemberInfo.
* Implemented copy hooks.
* All hooks now are stored in CTypeInfo/CMemberInfo/CVariantInfo.
* Most type specific functions now are implemented via function pointers instead of virtual functions.
*
* Revision 1.12  2000/09/01 13:16:00  vasilche
* Implemented class/container/choice iterators.
* Implemented CObjectStreamCopier for copying data without loading into memory.
*
* Revision 1.11  2000/08/15 19:44:39  vasilche
* Added Read/Write hooks:
* CReadObjectHook/CWriteObjectHook for objects of specified type.
* CReadClassMemberHook/CWriteClassMemberHook for specified members.
* CReadChoiceVariantHook/CWriteChoiceVariant for specified choice variants.
* CReadContainerElementHook/CWriteContainerElementsHook for containers.
*
* Revision 1.10  2000/07/18 17:22:58  vasilche
* GetTypeInfo & constructor of CObjectTypeInfo made public.
*
* Revision 1.9  2000/07/06 16:21:15  vasilche
* Added interface to primitive types in CObjectInfo & CConstObjectInfo.
*
* Revision 1.8  2000/07/03 18:42:35  vasilche
* Added interface to typeinfo via CObjectInfo and CConstObjectInfo.
* Reduced header dependency.
*
* Revision 1.7  2000/06/16 16:31:05  vasilche
* Changed implementation of choices and classes info to allow use of the same classes in generated and user written classes.
*
* Revision 1.6  2000/05/09 16:38:33  vasilche
* CObject::GetTypeInfo now moved to CObjectGetTypeInfo::GetTypeInfo to reduce possible errors.
* Added write context to CObjectOStream.
* Inlined most of methods of helping class Member, Block, ByteBlock etc.
*
* Revision 1.5  2000/05/04 16:23:10  vasilche
* Updated CTypesIterator and CTypesConstInterator interface.
*
* Revision 1.4  2000/03/29 15:55:20  vasilche
* Added two versions of object info - CObjectInfo and CConstObjectInfo.
* Added generic iterators by class -
* 	CTypeIterator<class>, CTypeConstIterator<class>,
* 	CStdTypeIterator<type>, CStdTypeConstIterator<type>,
* 	CObjectsIterator and CObjectsConstIterator.
*
* Revision 1.3  2000/03/07 14:05:30  vasilche
* Added stream buffering to ASN.1 binary input.
* Optimized class loading/storing.
* Fixed bugs in processing OPTIONAL fields.
*
* Revision 1.2  1999/08/13 20:22:57  vasilche
* Fixed lot of bugs in datatool
*
* Revision 1.1  1999/08/13 15:53:43  vasilche
* C++ analog of asntool: datatool
