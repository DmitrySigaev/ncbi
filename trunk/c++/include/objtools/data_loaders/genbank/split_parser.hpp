* $Log$
* Revision 1.1  2004/01/22 20:10:33  vasilche
* 1. Splitted ID2 specs to two parts.
* ID2 now specifies only protocol.
* Specification of ID2 split data is moved to seqsplit ASN module.
* For now they are still reside in one resulting library as before - libid2.
* As the result split specific headers are now in objects/seqsplit.
* 2. Moved ID2 and ID1 specific code out of object manager.
* Protocol is processed by corresponding readers.
* ID2 split parsing is processed by ncbi_xreader library - used by all readers.
* 3. Updated OBJMGR_LIBS correspondingly.
