//  This class encapsulates the simplest case:  the creation of a guide alignment between
//  the *masters* of two CDs in a single *validated* classical hierarchy:  this should 
//  always be possible.  The resulting guide is between the masters of
//  the two CDs, mapped to the alignment of their first common ancestor (or the family
//  root if 'MakeGuideToRoot' is used).  The IsOK() method will return 'false' if
//  the guide could not be made.  
//  Consensus masters are not treated specially --> the friend factory class helps hide the
//  details of managing consensus, or getting a guide between a pair of consensus masters.

//  In most cases, it is best to use the CGuideAlignmentFactory class to instantiate 
//  an object of this class.
