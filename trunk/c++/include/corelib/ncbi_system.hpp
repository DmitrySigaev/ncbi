* $Log$
* Revision 1.3  2001/07/23 15:59:36  ivanov
* Added possibility using user defined dump print handler
*
* Revision 1.2  2001/07/02 21:33:05  vakatov
* Fixed against SIGXCPU during the signal handling.
* Increase the amount of reserved memory for the memory limit handler
* to 10K (to fix for the 64-bit WorkShop compiler).
* Use standard C++ arg.processing (ncbiargs) in the test suite.
* Cleaned up the code. Get rid of the "Ncbi_" prefix.
