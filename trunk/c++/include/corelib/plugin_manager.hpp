/// @file plugin_manager.hpp
/// Plugin manager (using class factory paradigm).
///
/// Describe generic interface and provide basic functionality to advertise
/// and export a class factory. 
/// The class and class factory implementation code can be linked to
/// either statically (then, the class factory will need to be registered
/// explicitly by the user code) or dynamically (then, the DLL will be
/// searched for using plugin name, and the well-known DLL entry point
/// will be used to register the class factory, automagically).
/// 
/// - "class factory" -- An entity used to generate objects of the given class.
///                      One class factory can generate more than one version
///                      of the class.
/// 
/// - "interface"  -- Defines the implementation-independent API and expected
///                   behaviour of a class.
///                   Interface's name is provided by its class's factory,
///                   see IClassFactory::GetInterfaceName().
///                   Interfaces are versioned to track the compatibility.
/// 
/// - "driver"  -- A concrete implementation of the interface and its factory.
///                Each driver has its own name (do not confuse it with the
///                interface name!) and version.
/// 
/// - "host"    -- An entity (DLL or the EXEcutable itself) that contains
///                one or more drivers (or versions of the same driver),
///                which can implement one or more interfaces.
/// 
/// - "version" -- MAJOR (backward- and forward-incompatible changes in the
///                       interface and/or its expected behaviour);
///                MINOR (backward compatible changes in the driver code);
///                PATCH_LEVEL (100% compatible plugin or driver code changes).
///
