<h1> Working Independently In a C++ Subtree </h1>

An alternative to developing a new project from scratch is to work within a subtree of the
C++ libraries so as to utilize the header, source, and make files defined for that
subtree. One way to do this would be to check out the entire source tree and then do all
your work within the selected subtree(s) only. A better solution is to create a new
working directory and check out only the relevant subtrees into that directory. This is
somewhat complicated by the distributed organization of the c++ cvs tree: header files are
(recursively) contained in an <i> include </i> subtree, while source files are
(recursively) contained in a <i> src </i> subtree.  Thus multiple checkouts may be
required to set things up properly, and the customized makefiles (Makefile.*app) will
need to be modified. The shell script <i> import_project.sh </i> will do all of this 
for you. The syntax is:
<center> <xmp>
import_project.sh  subtree_name  [builddir] 
</xmp></center>
where:
<dl>
  <dt> - <i> subtree </i> is the path to a selected directory inside internal/c++/src/
  <dt> - <i> builddir </i>  optionally specifies which libraries should be linked to;
</dl>

As a result of executing this shell script, you will have a new directory created with the
pathname ./internal/c++/ whose structure contains "slices" of the original cvs
tree. Specifically, you will find:

<dl> 
<dt> ./internal/c++/CVS
<dt> ./internal/c++/include/CVS
<dt> ./internal/c++/include/subtree_name
<dt> ./internal/c++/src/CVS
<dt> ./internal/c++/src/subtree_name
</dl> 

The src and include directories will contain all of the requested subtree's source and
header files along with any hierarchically defined subdirectories. In addition, the script
will create new makefiles with the suffix "_app". These makefiles are generated from the
orginal customized make files ("Makefile.*.app") located in the original src subtrees.
The customized makefiles were designed to work only in conjunction with the build
directories in the larger C++ tree; the newly created makefile can be used directly in
your new working directories.<p>

Currently, there are eight project directories in the c++ tree, including:

<ul>
 <li> <i> cgi </i> - libraries for developing CGI applications 
 <li> <i> connect </i> - libraries for using socket connections
 <li> <i> corelib </i> - libraries for Toolkit foundations
 <li> <i> hello </i> - a simple example project that incorporates all but the serial libraries
 <li> <i> html </i> - libraries for developing HTML pages
 <li> <i> serial </i> - libraries for handling ASN, XML and files of other specified formats
</ul>

Two other project directories, <i> internal </i> and <i> objects </i>, are not intended
for general use, and the mechanisms in the import_project script for generating makefiles
are not guaranteed to work for these.  The <i> objects </i> subdirectories are used as the
original repositories for ASN.1 specifications, and subsequently, for writing the object
definitions and implementations created by the <i> datatool </i> program. These
definitions are available for use in your application as described in the section <a
href="asn.html"> Processing ASN.1 Data. </a> The <i> internal </i> subdirectory is used
for in-house development, and is the recommended work area for <i> new </i> projects.
