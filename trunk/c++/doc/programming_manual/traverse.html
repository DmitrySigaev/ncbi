<a name="locateClass"> <h3> Locating the Class Definitions </h3>
In order to traverse an ASN data object, you must become familiar with 
the class structures and access functions which implement the object. The
example provided here involves an ASN.1 Biostruc type which is implemented
by class <i>CBiostruc.</i> <p>

The first question then, is: how do I locate the class definitions implementing the object
to be traversed? As mentioned previously, the source browser is of little help in this case, as the
compiled object classes are not registered in the C++ tree.  The <i>include</i> and
<i>src</i> directories are available for browsing however, in <a
href="/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/include/objects"> <i> $NCBI/c++/include/objects </a> </i>and
<A href = "/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/src/objects"> <i>$NCBI/c++/src/objects</a></i>. <p>

Because we are using a <i>Biostruc</i>, the first place to search is in the <i>mmdb </i>
directories.  In the <i>mmdb1</i> directory, we find two classes: 
<a href="/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/include/objects/mmdb1/Biostruc.hpp"> <i> Biostruc.hpp</i> </a> and
<a href="/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/include/objects/mmdb1/Biostruc_Base.hpp"> <i> Biostruc_Base.hpp</i></a>.
As implied by the class names, <i>CBiostruc</i> inherits from <i>CBiostruc_Base</i>.  The <i> base</i>
class is where you must look for the definitions and access functions we will be using. However, it
is the <i> inherited class (CBiostruc.hpp) </i> that
