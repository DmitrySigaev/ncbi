<h1> Writing a Simple Application Project </h1>

This page describes what you will need to know to write the simplest possible
NCBI application using the C++ Toolkit and libraries. The program simply
prints a message to the screen.  Following this exercise however, will introduce
you to the foundation classes of the library and explicitly describe how
to set up your work environment and makefiles.

<a name="overview"></a>
<h3> Overview </h3>

There are three topics relevant to writing your first C++ project:

<ol>
  <li> Where to place the source and header files for the project
  <li> How to create a makefile which can link to the correct C++ libraries
  <li> How to use the fundamental C++ classes required in an NCBI application project
</ol>

What you put in your makefile will depend on where you define your
working directory. In this first example, we assume you will be
working <i><b> outside </i></b> the NCBI C++ tree, say in a directory called
<i>NewProj</i>. This is where you will write both your source and header
files.  The first step then, is to create the new working directory
and use the <i> new_project.sh </i> script to install a makefile there:<p>
<pre>
birch% mkdir NewProj

birch% $NCBI/c++/scripts/new_project.sh NewProj app $NCBI/c++/GCC-Debug/build
Created a model makefile "/home/zimmerma/NewProj/Makefile.NewProj_app". </font>

</pre>

The syntax of the script command is:
<center> <xmp>
new_project.sh  project_name  <app | lib>  [builddir]
</xmp></center>
where:
<dl>
  <dt> - <i> project_name </i> is the name of the directory you will be working in
  <dt> - <i> app (lib) </i> is used to indicate that you will be building an application (library)
  <dt> - <i> builddir </i>  (optional) specifies what version of the pre-built NCBI C++ Toolkit
		  libraries to link to
</dl>
Pre-built C++ Toolkit libraries are available for various platforms and compilers, in both
<i> debug</i> and <i> release </i> mode. To see a list of the available libraries for
the platform you are working on, consult <i>$NCBI/c++</i>. On the shell script command line, you should
follow the library name with the subdirectory <i>/build</i>. For example, on <i>Solaris</i>,
the following libraries are currently available:

<ul>
 <li> <i> Release, Debug </i> - for Sun Workshop
 <li> <i> GCC-Release, GCC-Debug </i> - for GCC
</ul>
So in this example, we specified the GNU compiler debugger version: <i>GCC-Debug/build</i>.<p>
For a list of currently supported compilers, see the Reference Manual's <a
href="../config.html#ref_Compilers"> <i>Installation and configuration</i> </a> page.  Running the
<i>new_project.sh</i> script will generate a ready-to-use makefile in the directory you just
created.  For a more detailed description of this and other scripts to assist you in the set-up
of your working environment, see the Reference Manual page <a href="../new_proj.html"> <i>Starting a
new C++ project</i></a>.

<a name="makefiles"></a>
<h3> The Project's Makefile </h3>

This is the file you just created with the above script - take a look
at it. In addition to other things, you should see definitions for:

<dl>
  <dt> - <i> builddir </i> - the last argument to the above script
  <dt> - <i> srcdir </i> - your current working directory (".")
  <dt> - <i> the application name </i> (APP)
  <dt> - <i> the object name(s) </i> (OBJ)
  <dt> - <i> specific libraries to link to in the NCBI C++ Toolkit</i> (LIB)
  <dt> - <i> all other libraries to link to (outside the C++ Toolkit)</i> (LIBS)
</dl>

The <i> builddir </i> specifies make's library path (-L), which in this case points to the
debug versions of the NCBI C++ Toolkit libraries containing symbol tables for <i> gdb </i>. LIB
lists the individual libraries in this path that you will be linking to. Minimally, this should
include <i>xncbi</i> - the library which implements the foundational classes for the C++
tools. Additional library names (e.g. <i>xhtml, xcgi, </i> etc.) can be added here. <p>

Since the shell script assumes you will be building a single executable with the same name
as your working directory, the application is defined simply as <i>NewProj</i>. Additional
targets to build can be added in the area indicated towards the end of the file. The list
of objects (OBJ) should include the names (without extensions) of all source files for the
application (APP). Again, the script makes the simplest assumption, i.e. that there is a
single source file named <i>NewProj.cpp</i>. Additional source names can be added here.

For a very simple application, this makefile is ready to be run. Try it out now, by creating
the file <i>NewProj.cpp</i>:

<font color = "#008080">
<pre>
// File name: NewProj.cpp

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello again, world" << endl;
}
</pre>
<font color = black>

and running: <i> make -f Makefile.NewProj_app</i>. <p>

Of course, it wasn't necessary to set up the directories and makefiles to accomplish this much,
as this example does not use any of the C++ classes or resources defined in the NCBI C++
Toolkit. The next example however, demonstrates a minimal application class that does use the NCBI
C++ Toolkit, and therefore does require this type of set up.

<a name="using"></a>
<h3> Using the NCBI Application Class </h3>

Five fundmental classes form the foundation of the C++ toolkit and more generally, the C++
libraries at NCBI:

<ul>
 <li> class <a href="#CNcbiApplication"> CNcbiApplication</a>
 <li> class <a href="#CNcbiArguments"> CNcbiArguments</a>
 <li> class <a href="#CNcbiEnvironment"> CNcbiEnvironment</a>
 <li> class <a href="#CNcbiRegistry"> CNcbiRegistry</a>
 <li> class <a href="#CNcbiDiag"> CNcbiDiag</a>
</ul>

<a name="CNcbiApplication"></a>

<a href="../docxx/CNcbiApplication.html">
<i>CNcbiApplication </i></a> is an abstract class used to define the basic functionality and
behavior of an NCBI application. Because this application class effectively supersedes the
C-style <i>main()</i> function, minimally, it must provide the same functionality, i.e.

<ul>
 <li> A mechanism to execute the actual application
 <li> A data structure for holding program arguments ("argv")
 <li> A data structure for holding environmental variables
</ul>

In addition, the application class provides the same features previously implemented in
the C Toolkit, namely:
<ul>
 <li> Mechanisms for specifying where, when, and how errors should be reported
 <li> Methods for reading, modifying, and writing information in the
				application's registry (configuration) file
</ul>

The mechansim to execute the application is provided by <i>CNcbiApplication</i>'s member
function <i>Run()</i> - which you must write your own implementation of. The <i>Run()</i> function
will be automatically invoked by <i>CNcbiApplication::AppMain()</i>,
after it has initialized its
<i> CNcbiArguments, CNcbiEnvironment, CNcbiRegistry</i>, and <i> CNcbiDiag</i> data members.<p>

<a name="CNcbiArguments"></a> The
<a href="../docxx/CNcbiArguments.html">
<i> CNcbiArguments </i></a> class provides a data structure for holding the application's
command-line arguments, along with methods for accessing and modifying these.  The data
structure is a simple C++ vector of strings. Thus access to it is implemented by member
functions using the built-in [] operator for arrays and vectors. Four additional class member
functions support retrieval and modification of the program name (initially
<i>argv</i>[0]). <p>

<a name="CNcbiEnvironment"></a> Similarly, the
<a href="../docxx/CNcbiEnvironment.html">
<i> CNcbiEnvironment </i></a> class provides a data structure for
storing, accessing, and modifying the environment variables accessed by the C library
routine <i>getenv()</i>. In this case the data structure is an associative array - a
C++ map container, that allows <i>[]</i> access with string rather than integer indexes. <p>

<a name="CNcbiRegistry"></a> The
<a href="../docxx/CNcbiRegistry.html">
<i> CNcbiRegistry </i></a> class is used to store, access, and modify runtime
information read from a configuration file. Previously, these files were by convention named
".*rc" files on <i> unix </i> systems. The convention for all platforms now is to name such
files <i>*.ini</i> (where * is by default the application name). <p>

Like the environment class, the registry class uses map structures to associate keys with
values. A configuration file entails more structure than environment variables however, as
the key-value pairs must be associated with specific sections. Accordingly, the registry
class's main data structure uses a map of maps, where the "containing" map is indexed by
sections while the "contained" map is indexed by keywords. <p>

<a name="CNcbiDiag"></a> The
<a href="../docxx/CNcbiDiag.html">
<i> CNcbiDiag </i></a> class implements much of the functionality of the NCBI C Toolkit error
processing mechanisms. Each instance of <i>CNcbiDiag</i> has a private buffer to
handle a <i>single</i> message, along with private severity level and post flags and their
associated get/set methods.<p>

The <i>CNcbiDiag</i> message buffer is initialized when the class is first instantiated. Additional
information can then be appended to the message using the overloaded stream operator <i><<</i>. Messages
can then be terminated explicitly using <i>CNcbiDiag's</i> stream manipulator <i>Endm</i>, or implicitly,
when the <i>CNcbiDiag</i> object exits scope. When the message is finally posted, a user-installed
callback function may be invoked to handle the message. The default is to post errors to <i>stderr</i>,
with the action determined by the severity level of the message. See also the discussion in the Reference Manual
section on <a href="../libs/err_msg.html#ref_Message"> <i>message posting</i></a> for a more in-depth coverage.
<p>
<a name="creating"></a>
<h3> Creating a Simple Application Class </h3>

<b>Step 1.</b> Define a subclass of the <i> CNcbiApplication </i> class.<p>

Because <i> CNcbiApplication::Run() </i> is defined as a pure virtual function, the class
cannot be used directly. Instead, you must first define a subclass which inherits from the
application class, and include an implementation of <i> Run() </i> in the subclass. <p>

Define the subclass in a header file, and in the subclass declaration, declare
<i>Run()</i> to be a virtual function:

<font color = "#008080">
<pre>
// File name: justApp.hpp

#ifndef NCBI_APP__HPP
#define NCBI_APP__HPP
#include &lt;corelib/ncbiapp.hpp&gt;

BEGIN_NCBI_SCOPE

class CTestApp : public CNcbiApplication {
public:
    virtual int Run ();
};

END_NCBI_SCOPE

#endif // NCBI_APP__HPP
</pre>
<font color = black>

<b>Step 2.</b> Define <i> main()</i> in the <i>*.cpp </i> file where you instantiate your
application subclass. <p>

Inside <i>main()</i>, instantiate your application subclass, and call its inherited function,
<i>AppMain()</i>. This file is also a good place to put the implementation of the
<i>Run()</i> function. Enclose the <i> Run() </i> implementation with <i> BEGIN_NCBI_SCOPE
</i> and <i> END_NCBI_SCOPE </i> statements, and precede <i>main() </i>(as well as any other
code using the NCBI C++ Toolkit) with a <i>
USING_NCBI_SCOPE </i> statement:

<font color = "#008080">
<pre>
// file justApp.cpp

#include "justApp.hpp"

BEGIN_NCBI_SCOPE

int CTestApp::Run() {
    cout << "Executing CTestApp::Run()!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

END_NCBI_SCOPE

USING_NCBI_SCOPE;

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
    CTestApp theTestApp;
    return theTestApp.AppMain(argc, argv);
}

</pre>
<font color = black>
<b>Step 3.</b> Assuming you have done all of this work in a project directory called
"justApp", and have already run the <i>new_project.sh</i> script to create the makefile, you are
now ready to build your first application using:
<p>
<center><pre>make -f Makefile.justApp_app </pre></center>
<p>
The <i> SCOPE</i> statements are actually macros defined in
<a href="../lxr/source/include/corelib/ncbistl.hpp">
<i>include/corelib/ncbistl.hpp</i></a>:
<font color = "#000080"><pre>
#define BEGIN_NCBI_SCOPE namespace NCBI_NS_NCBI {
#define END_NCBI_SCOPE }
#define USING_NCBI_SCOPE using namespace NCBI_NS_NCBI
</pre> <font color = black>

All code occurring between the <i>BEGIN</i> and <i> END</i> statements will be added to a
namespace called <i>NCBI_NS_NCBI</i>. The <i>USING</i> macro allows you to access everything
currently defined in the namespace without requiring the :: scope operator.

<h3> Inside the NCBI Application Class </h3>

To review what we've done so far:

<ol>
 <li> We defined a subclass of  <i>CNcbiApplication </i> with an implementation of <i>Run()</i>.
 <li> We created an instance of this class in <i>main()</i>.
 <li> We invoked the class member function <i> AppMain()</i>, and passed <i>argc, argv[]</i> to it.
</ol>

Here is a somewhat simplified view of the application class's definition:
<font color = "#008080">
<xmp>
class CNcbiApplication {
public:

    int AppMain (int argc, char **argv, char **envp,
	         EAppDiagStream diag, char* config, string& name);

    virtual void Init();
    virtual int  Run ();
    virtual void Exit();
    CNcbiArguments&   GetArguments();
    CNcbiEnvironment& GetEnvironment();
    CNcbiRegistry&    GetConfig();

protected:

    bool SetupDiag  (EAppDiagStream diag);
    bool LoadConfig (CNcbiRegistry& reg, const string* conf);

private:

    static CNcbiApplication*   m_Instance;
    auto_ptr<CNcbiArguments>   m_Args;
    auto_ptr<CNcbiEnvironment> m_Environ;
    auto_ptr<CNcbiRegistry>    m_Config;
    auto_ptr<CNcbiOstream>     m_DiagStream;
};
</xmp>
<font color = black>
As you can see, the constituents of the class are themselves embedded classes, and are
defined as private data members. The <i> GetXxx() </i> functions in the application class
provide access to these private members, while the members themselves implement methods to
modify their contents.<p>

The protected function <i> SetupDiag() </i> corresponds to the NCBI C toolkit functions used to
set up error posting. This function defines the output stream for error messages, along with
default severity levels.  <i> LoadConfig() </i> reads the program's <i>.ini </i> configuration
file to load the application's parameters into the registry's map structures.<p>

With the creation of an instance of the <i>CTestApp</i> class in <i> main()</i>, the constructor for
the class is automatically invoked. Because <i>CTestApp</i> is a subclass of <i>
CNcbiApplication</i>, that constructor is inherited from the parent class. The
constructor simply resets (clears) the values of the private data members, and sets
<i>m_Instance</i> to point to the newly created object.<p>

The <i> AppMain() </i> function is also inherited from the parent class. Although this
function accepts up to six arguments, this example passes only the first two, with missing
values supplied by defaults.  <i> AppMain() </i> begins by resetting the internal data
members with the actual values provided by the arguments of <i>main()</i>. Once these internal data
structures have been loaded,  <i> AppMain() </i> calls the virtual functions
<i> Init(), Run (), </i> and <i> Exit() </i> in succession to execute the application. <p>

The <i> Init() </i> and <i> Exit() </i> virtual functions are provided as places for developers to
add their own methods for specific applications. As this example does not require any
additional initialization/termination, these two functions simply return. The <i> Run() </i>
method prints out the message defined in <i>justApp.cpp</i> and exits.
