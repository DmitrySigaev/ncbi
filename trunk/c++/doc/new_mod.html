All new changes are being made to the Toolkit Book
at the following locations:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Official Release:</i> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">
    C++ Toolkit Book</a>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Development Version:</i> <a href="http://xpubmed0.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:5701/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">

    C++ Toolkit Book (no search engine, accessible from inside NCBI only)</a>. </li> </ul> The Development Version is the most recent documentation before it becomes an Official Release. While the Development Version is the lastest version, it is accessible only from inside NCBI, and the search engine functionality is currently missing. Also, the location of the Development Version may change without warning! So it is suggested that you use the Official Release, and use the Development Version only when necessary.</p> </i>

<!--EOW-->

Usually, each C++ module consists of 2 files (follow links for templates):
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="framewrk.hpp">Header file (*.hpp)</a> --
    API for the external users.  Ideally, this file contains only
    declarations of things (to be well commented!) that are exposed
    to external users.  No less, and no more.  Inline functions are to be defined here.
    This file is placed in the <span class="ncbi_dir">$NCBI/c++/include</span> directory.
  <li>
    <a href="framewrk.cpp">Source file (*.cpp)</a> --
    Definitions of non-inline functions and internally used things that
    should not be included to other modules.  This file is placed in
    the <span class="ncbi_dir">$NCBI/c++/src</span> directory.
</ul>

On occasion, a second private header file is required for good encapsulation.
Such second headers should be placed in the <span class="ncbi_dir">$NCBI/c++/src</span> directory along
with its including source file.

<p></p>
Each and every source file must include NCBI disclamer and (preferably)
CVS info using CVS keywords.  Then, the header file must be protected from double-include,
and it must define any inlined functions, if any.

<p></p>
The above examples contain a standard startup framework so
that one could just cut-and-paste one of them to start a new C++ file
(just dont forget to replace the "framewrk" stubs by your new module
name).
