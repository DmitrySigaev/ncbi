	 <h1>Introduction to some of C++ and STL features and techniques</h1>

	 <br></br>
	 <h2>C++ Implementation Guide</h2>

	 <h3>Use of STL(Standard Template Library)</h3>
	 <p>
	 Use the <a href="#ref_STL">Standard Template Library(STL)</a>, which
	 is part of ANSI/ISO C++.
	 It'll  make programming easier, as well as make it easier for others to
	 learn and maintain your code. </p>

	 <h3>Use of C++ exceptions</h3>
	 <p>
	 Exceptions are useful.
	 However, since exceptions unwind the stack, you must be careful to destroy
	 all resources (such as memory on the heap and file handles) in every
	 intermediate step in the stack unwinding.
	 That means you must always catch exceptions, even those you don't handle,
	 and delete everything you are using locally.
	 In most cases it's very convenient and safe to use the
	 <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/dec96pub/lib-utilities.html#lib.auto.ptr">auto_ptr</a>
	 template to ensure the freeing of temporary allocated dynamic
	 memory for the case of exception. </p>

	 <h3>Design</h3>
	 <p>
	 Use abstract base classes.
	 This increases the reusability of code.
	 Whether a base class should be abstract or not depends on the
	 potential for reuse.</p>
	 <p>
	 Don't expose complex member variables, rather expose member functions that 
	 manipulate the member variables.
	 This increases reusability and flexibility. 
	 For example, this frees you from having the string in-process -- it
	 could be in another process or even on another machine. </p>
	 <p>
	 Don't use multiple inheritance (i.e. <i>class A: public B, public C {}</i>)
	 unless creating interface instead of implementation.
	 Otherwise, you'll run into all sorts of problems with conflicting members,
	 especially if someone else owns a base class.
	 The best time to use multiple inheritance is when a subclass multiply
	 inherits from abstract base classes with only pure virtual functions. </p>
	 <p>
	 Some people prefer the
	 <a href="http://www.pureatria.com/uml/umlwp.html">Unified Modelling Language</a>
	 to describe the relationships between objects.</p>

	 <h2>C++ Tips and Tricks</h2>

	 <p>
	 Writing something like <i>map&lt;int, int, less&lt;int&gt;&gt;</i> will give you 
	 weird errors; instead write <i>map&lt;int, int, less&lt;int&gt; &gt;</i>.
	 This is because <i>&gt;&gt;</i> is reserved word. </p>
	 <p>
	 Do use pass-by-reference.
	 It'll cut down on the number of pointer related errors. </p>
	 <p>
	 Use <i>const</i> (or <i>enum</i>) instead of <i>#define</i> when you can.
	 This is much easier to debug. </p>

	 <p>
	 Header files should contain what they contain in C along with classes,
	 const's, and in-line functions (in-line functions are functions defined
	 within the braces of the class or declared <i>inline</i>.
	 In-line functions must be in header files as compilers need to see
	 the source in order to inline properly. </p>

	 <h2> Standard template library (STL) </h2>

	 <p>
	 The STL is a library included in ANSI/ISO C++ for stream, string, and
	 container(linked lists, etc.) manipulation. For SunPro 4.2 we've working
	 on installing a version from the
	 <a href="http://corp.metabyte.com/~fbp/stl/index.html">
		STL adaptation effort</a>
	 plus a string library from
	 <a href="http://corp.metabyte.com/~fbp/stl/components.html">
		Moderna Software</a>.
	 This library doesn't include a stream library -- with SunPro we are limited
	 to the older iostream library sun provides, which doesn't have classes 
	 like sstream.
	 <p>
	 In the future, we expect to use the version of STL included in the next
	 version of SunPro. Microsoft Visual C++ has had STL since version 5.0.
	 We haven't detected any non-configuration incompatibilities yet. 
	 <p>

	 <a name="STL_tips">
	 <h3>STL tips and tricks</h3>
	 <p>
	 end() does not return an iterator to the last element of a container,
	 rather it returns a iterator just beyond the last element of the container.
	 This is so you can do constructs like
	 <i>for (iterator = container.begin();  iterator != container.end();  iterator++)</i>.
	 If you want to access the end element, use <i>--container.end()</i>.
	 <p>
	 Iterator misuse causes the same problems as pointer misuse.
	 There are
	 <a href="http://corp.metabyte.com/~fbp/stl/effort.html#extensions">
		versions of the STL</a>
	 that flag incorrect use of iterators, including STL adaptation effort.
	 <p>
	 Iterators are guarantee to remain valid after insertion and deletion
	 from list containers, but not vector containers.
	 Check to see if the container you are using preserves iterators. 
	 <p>
	 If you create a container of pointers to objects, the objects are not
	 destroyed when the container is destroyed, only the pointers are.
	 Other that maintaining the objects yourself, there are several strategies
	 detailed in the <a href="books.html">literature</a>.
	 <p>
	 If you pass a container to a function, don't add a local object to the
	 container.
	 The local variable will be destroyed when you leave the function.
	 <p>
	 When declaring a map, use the form
	 <i>map&lt;string, string, less&lt;string&gt; &gt;</i>.
	 The third argument isn't necessary on most compilers, but SunPro 4.2 is 
	 a bit old and needs it because it doesn't do default values for templates.
	 <p>
	 SunPro 4.2 uses and older (and less functional) version of
	 <i>&lt;iostream&gt;</i> called <i>&lt;iostream.h&gt;</i>
	 <p>
	 SunPro 4.2 doesn't understand <i>&quot;using namespace std;&quot;</i>, and it
	 was decided to prohibite the explicit use <i>&quot;using namespace XXX;&quot;</i>
	 in NCBI C++ code. Thus, if you need to use STL just use special
	 preprocessor macro <i>"NCBI_USING_STL;"</i>(it is defined in
	 <i>"&lt;ncbistd.hpp&gt;"</i>, see <a href="framewrk.cpp">example</a>).
	 <p>
	 The <i>basic_string</i> class has a few
