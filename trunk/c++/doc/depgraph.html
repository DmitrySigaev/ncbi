<h1>NCBI C++ Library Dependency Graph</h1>

This graph was obtained by building the full toolkit and then
running the following commands:
<pre>
.../bin/depgraph .../lib/lib* > depgraph.out
.../bin/depgraph2dot -simplify -in depgraph.out -out depgraph.dot
dot -Tps -o depgraph.ps depgraph.dot
convert -density 100 depgraph.ps PPM:- | ppmtogif > depgraph.gif
</pre>
where <tt>dot</tt> comes from AT&amp;T's
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">Graphviz</a>
package.  If you are at NCBI, you can find the source to
<tt>depgraph</tt> and <tt>depgraph2dot</tt>
<a href="http://intranet.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/internal/util/depgraph/">here.</a>
Dashed lines represent containment.
<p>
You can find a version of the graph which includes internal projects
<a href="depgraph-full.pdf">here</a>.
<!-- produced as follows:
* \ls $NCBI/c++/Release/lib > all-libs
* pick a single member of each static/dynamic triplet
  (libfoo.a, libfoo.so, libfoo-static.a)
* depgraph `cat all-libs` $NCBI/altlib/libncbi* /usr/lib/libm.a > depgraph-full.out
* egrep -v 'altlib|/usr/lib' depgraph-full.out > depgraph-full.out2
* depgraph2dot -landscape -simplify < depgraph-full.out2 > depgraph-full.dot
* remove "; rotate = 90" from depgraph-full.dot
* dot -Tps -o depgraph-full.out depgraph-full.dot
* distall -pagesize 11 8.5 in depgraph-full.ps
