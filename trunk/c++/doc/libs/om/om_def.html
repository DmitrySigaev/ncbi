<h3><a name="Object_manager"></a>Object manager</h3>
<p>
Object manager manages data objects, provides them to Scopes when
needed. It knows all existing Data sources and Data loaders. When a Scope
needs  one, it receives a data object from the Object Manager. This enables
sharing  and  reusing of all relevant data between different Scopes. Another
function  of  the Object Manager is letting Scopes know each other, letting
Scopes to communicate.  This is a barely visible entity.
</p>



<h3><a name="Scope"></a>Scope</h3>
<p>
Scope is a top-level object available to a client. Its purpose is
to  define  a scope of visibility and reference resolution and provide access
to the  bio sequence data.
</p>



<h3><a name="Data_loader"></a>Data loader</h3>
<p>
Data loader is a link between in-process data storage and remote,
out-of process data source. Its purpose is to communicate with a remote
data source, receive data from there, understand what is already received
and what is  missing, and pass data to the local storage (Data source).
Data loader maintains   its own index of what data is loaded already and
references that data in  the Data source.
</p>


<h3><a name="Data_source"></a>Data source</h3>
<p>
Data source stores bio sequence data locally. Scope communicates with
this  object to obtain any sequence data. Data source creates and maintains
internal  indices to facilitate information search. Data source may contain
data of several  top-level
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQSET.HTML">Seq_entries</a>.
In case client pushes an externally constructed Seq_entry object
in  the  Scope, such object is stored in a separate Data source. In this case
Data  source has only one top-level Seq_entry. From the other side, when
Data source  is linked to a Data loader, it will contain all top-level Seq_entries
retrieved  by that loader.
</p>



<h3><a name="Bioseq_handle"></a>Bioseq handle</h3>
<p>
Bioseq handle is a kind of
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/BIOSEQ.HTML">Bioseq</a>
proxy. Its purpose is to facilitate access to Bioseq data. When client
wants to access particular biological sequence, it requests a Bioseq handle
from the Scope.
</p>



<h3><a name="Bioseq_core"></a>Bioseq core</h3>
Bioseq core is partially populated Bioseq, or, better say, Bioseq
as  it  is loaded at the moment.


<h3><a name="Seq_map"></a>Seq map</h3>
<p>
Seq map contains a general information about the sequence &#8211; location
and   type of data only.
</p>


<h3><a name="Seq_vector"></a>Seq vector</h3>
<p>
Seq vector contains sequence data only.
</p>


<h3><a name="Description_iterator"></a>Description iterator</h3>
<p>
Description iterator traverses bio sequence descriptions
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/BIOSEQ.HTML">Seq_descr</a>)
in the Seq_entry. It starts with the description(s) of requested
sequence    (Bioseq) and then retrieves all sequence descriptions iterating
through  the  tree nodes up to the top-level Seq_entry. Starting Bioseq is
defined  by sequence  id
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQLOC.HTML">Seq_id</a>).
Descriptions do not contain information about what Bioseq they
describe, so the only way to figure it out is by description location
on the tree.
</p>



<h3><a name="Annotation_iterator"></a>Annotation iterator</h3>
<p>
Annotation iterators are utility classes for traversing sequence annotation
data. Each annotation contains a reference to one or more regions on one
or more sequences (Bioseq). From one point of view this is good, because
we can always say which sequences are related to the given annotation. From
the other point of view, this creates a lot of problems, since an annotation
referencing the sequence may be stored in another sequence/Seq_entry/tree.
The annotation iterators attempt to find all objects related to the given
location in all Data sources from the current Scope. Data sources create
indexes for all annotations by their locations.
</p>
<p>
There are three specialized annotation iterator classes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feature  iterator &#8211; traverses sequence features
    (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQFEAT.HTML">Seq_feat</a>);</li>
  <li>Graph data iterator  &#8211; traverses sequence graphs
    (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQRES.HTML">Seq_graph</a>);</li>
  <li>Alignment iterator  &#8211; traverses sequence alignments descriptions
    (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQALIGN.HTML">Seq_align</a>).</li>
</ul>
