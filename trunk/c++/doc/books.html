	 <br>
	 <h2>Books</h2>

	 <li><p>
	 <i>On To C++,  by Patrick Henry Winston</i><br><br>
	 If you are looking for a short and concise tutorial, this is as close
	 as you can get. It doesn't cover all of C++, but many of the essential
	 features (except the STL). A decent first book to buy. </p>

	 <li><p>
	 <i>The C++ Primer, Third Edition</i>,
	 by Stanley Lippman and Josee Lajoie <br><br>
	 A decent book, much expanded from previous editions.
	 Gets carried away with very long examples, which makes it harder
	 to use as a reference.
	 Full coverage of ANSI/ISO C++. </p>

	 <li><p>
	 <i>The C++ Programming Language, Third Edition</i>
	 by Bjarne Stroustrup <br><br>
	 Often called the best book for C++ written in Danish.
	 Written by the designer  of C++, this is a difficult read unless you
	 already know C++.
	 Full coverage  of ANSI/ISO C++. </p>

	 <li><p>
	 <i>Effective C++, Second Edition: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs</i>,
	 by Scott Meyers. <br><br>
	 A must-have that describes lots of tips, tricks, and pitfalls of C++
	 programming. </p>

	 <li><p>
	 <i>More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs</i>,
	 by Scott Meyers.<br><br>
	 Same as above. For example, how is the new operator different from
	 operator new? Operator new is called by the new operator to allocate
	 memory for the object being created.
	 This is how you hook your own malloc into C++. </p>
