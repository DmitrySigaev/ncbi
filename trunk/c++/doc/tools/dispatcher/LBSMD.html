<h2><a name="ref_Overview">Overview</a></h2>

In general, <tt>LBSMD</tt> should be run at NCBI site on every host, which carries either public
or private servers implementing NCBI service(s) (see, however discussion about <i>static</i> servers
<a href="#ref_Static">below</a>). The services include CGIs or standalone servers
to access NCBI data. Each service has a name assigned to it, <tt>TaxServer</tt>
for instance. The name uniquely identifies the service, and - <u>most importantly</u> -
the protocol used for data exchange, i.e. any client connecting to service <tt>TaxServer</tt>
knows how to communicate with that service, whereas the service can be
implemented in various ways on hosts across NCBI.
That is, the service could be implemented as a standalone server on
a host <tt>X</tt>, and as a CGI on the same or another host <tt>Y</tt>.
(Note however, that on a certain host, there should <i>not</i> be two or more
servers of the same <a href="#ref_ServerType">type</a> for the same service.)
Moreover, the same server can implement several services, that is
the services with different names. For example, one service (like,
<tt>Entrez2</tt>) can accept binary data only, and another one
(say, <tt>Entrez2Text</tt>) can accept data only in text format.
For the server, the distinction between those two could be in this case
made by using a <a href="#ref_ContentType">content type specifier</a>.

<p>
The goal of <tt>LBSMD</tt> is to maintain a table of all services
available at NCBI at the moment. In addition, <tt>LBSMD</tt> keeps track of
services, which are found non-functional (dead services), and
it is also responsible for propagating trouble reports,
obtained back from the applications about their experience with
advertized services (e.g. an advertized service is not
technically dead, but generates sort of garbage when accessed).
Further in this document the latter kind of feedback is called a
<i>penalty</i>.

<p>
The principle of load-balancing is simple: each server, implementing
the required service, is assigned a (calculated) rate. The higher the rate
the better the chance for that the server to be chosen. Note that load-balancing
is thus almost never deterministic (see however, discussion of negative
<a href="#ref_Bonus">local bonus coefficient</a> below).

<p>
It is not obviously enough that the load-balancing daemon does not calculate the rates of servers.
Its primary goal is to collect all necessary information for that.
Actual calculation of current rates of (non-<a href="#ref_Static"><i>static</i></a>) servers is based on
many parameters of the system, including the load average, the number of
CPUs and processes, etc. The rate calculation fomulas can be found in
<a href="../../lxr/source/src/connect/ncbi_lbsm.c"><b><i>connect/ncbi_lbsm.c</i></b></a>,
which is a part of <a href="../../libs/conn.html#ref_ServiceAPI">Service API</a>, not <tt>LBSMD</tt>.

<h2><a name="ref_Details"><tt>LBSMD</tt> in Details</a></h2>

<tt>LBSMD</tt> is configured by means of a configuration file, which is also
shared with <a href="DISPD.html">NCBI dispatching CGI</a>.
Each line in the file either defines a service, or is a part of
the host environment, or is en empty line (the one entirely blank or containing a
comment only). Empty lines are all ignored in the file.
Any single configuration line can be split into several physical lines by
inserting a backslash symbol (\) before the line breaks.
A comment is introduced by a hash symbol (#).

<p>
A configuration line of the form
<pre>
<font color="#009900">name=value</font>
</pre>
places itself in the <i>host environment</i>. The host environment can be accessed by
clients while making the service name resolution. Often, the host environment
tells the client about limitations/options, which the host has, and based on this
additional information, the client can make a decision whether the server
(despite that it is implementing the service) is suitable for carrying out client's request.
For example, the host environment can give the client an idea about what are the databases
available on the host. The host environment is not interpreted or used in any way both by the daemon, and
by the load-balancing algorithm, except for that <tt>name</tt> must be a valid identifier.
The <tt>value</tt> may be practically anything, even empty.
It is left solely on the client to parse the environment and to look for the information in interest.
<br>
<u>Note</u> that white characters surrounding <tt>name</tt> are not preserved, but they are
preserved in <tt>value</tt>, i.e. when appear after the equal sign.

<p>
A <i>service</i> is defined by a line of the form
<pre>
<font color="#009900">service_name [check_time] server_descriptor [| launcher_info ]</font>
</pre>
<ul>
<li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>service_name</tt></font> specifies the service, for instance
<tt>TaxServer</tt>.
<li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>[check_time]</tt></font> is an optional parameter (if omitted,
the surrounding square brackets must go, too),
which specifies the number of seconds for periodic checkups.
For example, <tt>[120]</tt> means to check the server once
every 2 minutes. Note the square brackets - they are required.
<li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>server_descriptor</tt></font> specifies address of the server and
supplies additional information, which is described in details later in this document.
An example of the <tt>server_descriptor</tt>:
<pre>
<font color="navy">STANDALONE somehost:1234 R=3000 L=yes S=yes B=-200</font>
</pre>
<li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>launcher_info</tt></font> is basically a command line,
preceded by a pipe symbol (|), delimiting from <tt>server_descriptor</tt>.
It is an optional argument, and is only required
for <a href="#ref_ServerType">servers of type</a> <tt>NCBID</tt>.
</ul>

<p>
<tt>Server_descriptor</tt>, also described in details in
<a href="../../lxr/source/include/connect/ncbi_server_info.h"><b><i>connect/ncbi_server_info.h</i></b></a>,
consists of the following fields
<ol>
<font color="#009900"><tt>server_type [host][:port] [arguments] [flags]</tt><br></font>
where:
<ul type=square>
<li><a name="ref_ServerType"><tt>server_type</tt></a> is one of the following keywords:<br>
  <ul compact type=bullet>
  <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>NCBID</tt></font> for servers launched by <a href="DISPD.html#ref_NCBID"><tt>ncbid.cgi</tt></a>;
  <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>STANDALONE</tt></font> for standalone servers listening on dedicated ports;
  <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>HTTP_GET</tt></font> for servers, which are CGI programs, accepting only <i>GET</i> request method;
  <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>HTTP_POST</tt></font> for servers, which are CGI programs, accepting only <i>POST</i> request method;
  <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>HTTP_POST</tt></font> for servers, which are CGI programs, accepting both <i>GET</i> and <i>POST</i> request methods.
  </ul>
<li>Both <font color="#CC33CC"><tt>host</tt></font> and <font color="#CC33CC"><tt>port</tt></font> parameters are optional. Defaults are local host, and
port 80 except for <tt>STANDALONE</tt> servers, which do <i>not</i> have a default port value.</br>
<a name="ref_Static">If <tt>host</tt> <b><u>is</u></b> specified</a> (even, <tt>localhost</tt>, or local host name)
then the described server is not a subject for variable load-balancing, but a so-called <i>static</i>
server. Such a server always has a constant rate, independent on the host load.
<li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>arguments</tt></font> are required for <tt>HTTP*</tt> servers, and must give
the local absolute URL of the CGI, and optionally parameters, like:
<ol>
<font color="navy"><tt>/somepath/somecgi.cgi?param1&amp;param2=value2&amp;param3=value3</tt></font>
</ol>
If no parameters are to be supplied, then question mark (?) must not be
specified.<br>
For <tt>NCBID</tt> servers, arguments are parameters to
pass to the server, and are formed as arguments for CGI programs, i.e.
<ol>
<font color="navy"><tt>param1&amp;param2&amp;param3=value</tt></font>
</ol>
As a special rule, <font color="navy"><tt>''</tt></font> (two single quotes) may be used to denote empty argument for <tt>NCBID</tt> server.<br>
<tt>STANDALONE</tt> servers do <i>not</i> take any <tt>arguments</tt>.
<li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>flags</tt></font> can come in no specific order (but no more than one instance of a flag is allowed),
and essentially are optional modifiers of the values, used by default. The following flags are
recognized:
<ul type=circle>
  <li>load calculation keyword:
  <ul type=bullet>
    <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>Blast</tt></font> to use special algorithm for status calculation, acceptable for <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST">BLAST</a>
	applications. The algorithm uses instant values of the host load, and thus is less conservative and more
	reactive than the ordinary one;
    <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>Regular</tt></font> to use an ordinary rate calculation (default, and the only load calculation
    option allowed for <a href="#ref_Static"><i>static</i></a> servers).
  </ul>
  <li>base rate:
  <ul type=bullet>
  <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>R=value</tt></font> sets base server reachability rate (as a floating point number),
  default is 1000. Any negative value makes the server unreachable, and a value of 0
  uses the default. The maximal base rate is 100000.
  </ul>
  <li>locality marker:
  <ul type=bullet>
     <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>L={yes|no}</tt></font> sets (if <tt>yes</tt>) the server to be <i>local only</i>. Default is <tt>no</tt>.
     <a href="../../libs/conn.html#ref_ServiceAPI">Service API</a> returns <i>local only</i> servers
     in the case of mapping with the use of <tt>LBSMD</tt> running on the same (local) host. Otherwise, if service mapping
     occurs using network (via exchange with <a href="DISPD.html"><tt>dispd.cgi</tt></a>), then
     <i>local only</i> servers are not seen.
  </ul>
  <li>stateful server:
  <ul type=bullet>
     <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>S={yes|no}</tt></font> sets (if <tt>yes</tt>) that the server can only accept dedicated connections,
     and is not capable of doing <i>stateless</i> (HTTP-like) data exchange. Those servers are only
     accessed via creating a stream connection to the server, and the entire data transfer is to happen
     while the connection is alive. Default is <tt>no</tt>.<br>
     <u>Note</u> that due to mutual incompatibility, Web-browsers <i>cannot</i> directly
     connect to <i>stateful</i> servers.
  </ul>
  <li><a name="ref_ContentType">content type specifier</a>:
  <ul type=bullet>
     <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>C=type/subtype</tt></font> specifies what is the data type that the server accepts/generates.
     There is no default value for this flag.
  </ul>
  <li><a name="ref_Bonus">local bonus coefficient</a>:
  <ul type=bullet>
     <li><font color="#CC33CC"><tt>B=value</tt></font>. The interpretation of this flag depends on the sign of <tt>value</tt>. When positive,
     <tt>value</tt> specifies a multiplier, which applies to the server rate when the server is locally run.
     When zero (default), the slight default rate increase takes effect for locally run servers. When <tt>value</tt> is negative, the
     locally run server overrides those even having higher rates and preceding the local one, but only if the local server has
     a rate, which is not in the percentile (expressed by the absolute <tt>value</tt>) of average rest rate of all other servers,
     implementing the service.<br>
     For example, a server on a <u>local</u> host <tt>Z</tt> configured with <tt>B=-5</tt> (and currently having rate of 100)
     will be chosen by the <u>local</u> load-balancer even if there are hosts <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt>, having rates 1000 and 2000,
     because 100 is more than 5% of (1000 + 2000)/2 = 1500, which is 75.</br>
     <u>Note</u> again that for this coefficient to play, <i>both</i> server <i>and</i> mapping must be on the same host.
  </ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>
The main loop of the daemon comprises of periodic checks of configuration file and reloads of the configuration if
necessary, checks and processings of incoming messages from other load-balancing daemons running on
other hosts, generating and brodacasting messages to the other hosts about the load of the system and
configured services. Also, the daemon periodically checks whether the configured servers are alive, trying
to connect to them, and then to immediately disconnect, without any data exchange. This way the daemon
is only able to check whether the network port is alive. Further server accessibility information could
be sent back to the daemon by applications, which actually use the server (see <a href="#ref_Penalizer">below</a>).

<p>
The daemon can be configured by a dozen of switches, which could modify certain
parameters from their default values. To see all command-line switches, switch <tt>-h</tt> may be used,
or NCBI Intranet users <i>only</i> can click <a href="http://pluto/Service/lbsmd.cgi">here</a>.
Also, daemon reacts on <tt>HUP</tt> signal to reload its configuration,
and both <tt>INT</tt> and <tt>TERM</tt> signals to gracefully quit. Despite very high stability, usually
the daemon is forcibly started from <tt>crontab</tt> each every few minutes on all production hosts to ensure
that the daemon is always running. This technique is safe, because no more than one instance of the daemon
is permitted on a certain host, and any attempt to start more than one is rejected.

<p>
<tt>LBSMD</tt> can generate output to the logfile, which can be limited in size to prevent
disk from flooding with messages. NCBI Intranet users <i>only</i>
<a href="http://pluto/Service/lbsmd.cgi?log">can take a look</a>
at (no more than 100) recent lines of the logfile on host <tt>pluto</tt>.

<h2><a name="ref_Example">Example of Configuration File</a></h2>

Below is an excerpt from an example configuration file, which declares some of the host environment,
advertizes one standalone stateful server, and one NCBID service, both implementing the same
service, and one HTTP service, which is a local service only.

<pre>
#
# This is a configuraiton file of LBSMD and DISPD
#

# This goes to host environment (rather practical)

# Standalone server listening on port 9999
TestService STANDALONE :9999 S=yes R=2000

# NCBID server (note empty quotes to prevent treatment of Regular as
# an argument, and the path and parameters to the executable)
TestService NCBID      '' Regular | /home/webuser/TestService/a.out "parameter 1"

# Local HTTP service w/o checks (note [0])

<h2><a name="ref_Penalizer">Server Penalizer</a></h2>

There is a means for application to report problems with accessing a certain server back to
the load-balancing daemon, in the form of the penalty, a value in the range <tt>[0..100]</tt>,
showing in percents, how bad the server is. The value of 0 means the server is completely okay,
whilst 100 means the server (is misbehaving and) should <i>not</i> be used at all. The penalty is
not a constant value: once set it starts to decrease in time, first slowly, then faster and
faster, until reaches zero. This way, if a server was penalized for some reason beyond its control,
but then that reason has gone, then the server becomes available as its penalty (not been
reset by applications again in the absence of the offending reason) goes itself zero.

<p>
Technically, the penalty is maintained by a daemon, which has the server configured.
That is, received by a certain host, which may be different from the one, where the
server was put into configuration file, the penalty first migrates to that host,
and then the daemon on that host announces that the server was penalized.</br>
<u>Note</u> that once the daemon is restarted, the penalty information is lost.

<p>
<a href="../../libs/conn.html#ref_ServiceAPI">Service API</a> has a call
<a href="../../lxr/ident?i=SERV_Penalize"><b><i>SERV_Penalize()</i></b></a>,
declared in <a href="../../lxr/source/include/connect/ncbi_service.h"><b><i>connect/ncbi_service.h</i></b></a>,
which can be used to set the penalty for the last server, obtained from the mapping iterator.

<p>
For the script files (like ones used to start/stop servers), there is a dedicated utility program called
<a href="../../lxr/source/src/connect/daemons/lbsm_penalize.c"><b><i>lbsm_penalize</i></b></a>,
which sets the penalty from the command line. Because of intervening  the load-balancing
mechanism substantially, this command should be used with care.

<p>
<b><i>lbsm_penalize</i></b> is now a part of LBSM set of tools, installed on all hosts, running <tt>LBSMD</tt>.
As explained above, penalizing means making a server less favorable for choosing by load-balancing
mechanism. Because of the fact that the full penalty of 100% makes a server unavailable for clients at all,
at the time when the server is about to shut down (restart), it is wise to increase the server penalty
to the maximal value, thus excluding the server from the service mapping. (Otherwise, load-balancing daemon
might not immediately notice that the server is down, and continue dispatching to that server.)
Usually penalty takes at most 5 seconds to propagate to all participating network hosts.
That is, before the actual server shutdown, the following sequence of commands may be used:
<pre>
<font color="navy">&gt; ~ncbiduse/Service/lbsm_penalize 'Servicename STANDALONE 100 host 120'
&gt; sleep 5
&gt; shutdown the server</font>
</pre>

The effect of the above is to set the maximal penalty <tt>100</tt> for the service <tt>Servicename</tt> (of type
<tt>STANDALONE</tt>) running on host <tt>host</tt> for at least <tt>120</tt> seconds, the last parameter.
(After 120 seconds the normal behavior of the penalty occurs, i.e. automatical decreasing in time, if not reset again to a different value.)
In order to be realized by all hosts of the subnet, <tt>sleep 5</tt> precedes the server shutdown command.
Please note single quotes surrounding penalty specification: they are required in the shell because
<b><i>lbsm_penalize</i></b> takes only one argument, the entire penalty specification.

<p>
As soon as the server is down, <tt>LBSMD</tt> detects it in the matter of several seconds
(if not instructed otherwise via configuration file), and then never dispatches to the server until it is up.

In some circumstances, the following command may come handy:
<pre>
<font color="navy">&gt; ~ncbiduse/Service/lbsm_penalize 'Servicename STANDALONE 0 host'</font>
</pre> 
which resets the penalty to 0 (no penalty), and is useful, when e.g. as for the previous example, the server is restarted
and ready in less than 120 seconds, but the penalty is still held high by <tt>LBSMD</tt>.
