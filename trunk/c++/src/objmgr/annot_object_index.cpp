* $Log$
* Revision 1.2  2003/11/26 17:55:56  vasilche
* Implemented ID2 split in ID1 cache.
* Fixed loading of splitted annotations.
*
* Revision 1.1  2003/10/07 13:43:23  vasilche
* Added proper handling of named Seq-annots.
* Added feature search from named Seq-annots.
* Added configurable adaptive annotation search (default: gene, cds, mrna).
* Fixed selection of blobs for loading from GenBank.
* Added debug checks to CSeq_id_Mapper for easier finding lost CSeq_id_Handles.
* Fixed leaked split chunks annotation stubs.
* Moved some classes definitions in separate *.cpp files.
