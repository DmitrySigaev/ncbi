/*
* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* $Log$
* Revision 1.12  2003/05/20 15:44:38  vasilche
* Fixed interaction of CDataSource and CDataLoader in multithreaded app.
* Fixed some warnings on WorkShop.
* Added workaround for memory leak on WorkShop.
*
* Revision 1.11  2003/04/24 16:12:38  vasilche
* Object manager internal structures are splitted more straightforward.
* Removed excessive header dependencies.
*
* Revision 1.10  2003/03/21 19:22:51  grichenk
* Redesigned TSE locking, replaced CTSE_Lock with CRef<CTSE_Info>.
*
* Revision 1.9  2003/03/12 20:09:34  grichenk
* Redistributed members between CBioseq_Handle, CBioseq_Info and CTSE_Info
*
* Revision 1.8  2003/02/24 18:57:22  vasilche
* Make feature gathering in one linear pass using CSeqMap iterator.
* Do not use feture index by sub locations.
* Sort features at the end of gathering in one vector.
* Extracted some internal structures and classes in separate header.
* Delay creation of mapped features.
*
* Revision 1.7  2003/02/05 17:59:17  dicuccio
* Moved formerly private headers into include/objects/objmgr/impl
*
* Revision 1.6  2002/12/26 20:55:18  dicuccio
* Moved seq_id_mapper.hpp, tse_info.hpp, and bioseq_info.hpp -> include/ tree
*
* Revision 1.5  2002/12/26 16:39:24  vasilche
* Object manager class CSeqMap rewritten.
*
* Revision 1.4  2002/07/08 20:51:02  grichenk
* Moved log to the end of file
* Replaced static mutex (in CScope, CDataSource) with the mutex
* pool. Redesigned CDataSource data locking.
*
* Revision 1.3  2002/05/06 03:28:48  vakatov
* OM/OM1 renaming
*
* Revision 1.2  2002/02/25 21:05:29  grichenk
