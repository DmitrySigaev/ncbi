* $Log$
* Revision 1.9  2002/07/08 20:51:00  grichenk
* Moved log to the end of file
* Replaced static mutex (in CScope, CDataSource) with the mutex
* pool. Redesigned CDataSource data locking.
*
* Revision 1.8  2002/05/06 03:28:46  vakatov
* OM/OM1 renaming
*
* Revision 1.7  2002/05/03 21:28:08  ucko
* Introduce T(Signed)SeqPos.
*
* Revision 1.6  2002/04/05 21:26:19  grichenk
* Enabled iteration over annotations defined on segments of a
* delta-sequence.
*
* Revision 1.5  2002/03/05 16:08:13  grichenk
* Moved TSE-restriction to new constructors
*
* Revision 1.4  2002/03/04 15:07:47  grichenk
* Added "bioseq" argument to CAnnotTypes_CI constructor to iterate
* annotations from a single TSE.
*
* Revision 1.3  2002/02/21 19:27:04  grichenk
* Rearranged includes. Added scope history. Added searching for the
* best seq-id match in data sources and scopes. Updated tests.
