-- Contents of the MMDB database are currently based on files distributed by
-- the Protein Data Bank, PDB.  These data are changed in form, as described
-- in this specification. To some extent they are also changed in content, in 
-- as much as many data items implicit in PDB are made explicit, and others are
-- corrected or omitted as a consequence of validation checks.  The semantics
-- of MMDB data items are indicated by comments within the specification below.
-- These comments also explain in detail the manner in which data items from 
-- PDB have been mapped into MMDB. 

MMDB DEFINITIONS ::=

BEGIN

EXPORTS Biostruc, Biostruc-id;

IMPORTS Biostruc-graph FROM MMDB-Chemical-graph 
	Biostruc-model FROM MMDB-Structural-model
	Biostruc-history FROM MMDB-Database-management
	Pub-set FROM NCBI-Pub;

-- A structure report or "biostruc" describes the components of a biomolecular 
-- assembly in terms of their names and descriptions, and a chemical graph 
-- giving atomic formula, connectivity and chirality. It also gives one or more
-- three-dimensional model structures, literally a mapping of the atoms, 
-- residues and/or molecules of each component into a measured three-
-- dimensional space. A model structure may also describe certain structural 
-- features by name and type. 

-- Note that a biostruc may contain multiple 3-dimensional models, meaning
-- coordinate sets which describe alternative representations of the spatial 
-- structure of the biomolecular assembly. Models derived from PDB files have 
-- two simplified "views" which are useful in computational applications, a 
-- single-coordinate-per-atom model, and a single-coordinate-per-residue model.
-- Both omit information pertaining to ensemble models, alternate conformations
-- and/or statistical disorder.  Complete PDB structure descriptions which 
-- include statistical disorder are provided as an additional model or models. 

-- Note also that a biostruc may contain cross references to other databases,
-- including citations to relevant scientific literature. These cross 
-- references use object types from other NCBI data specifications, which are 
-- "imported" into MMDB. 

Biostruc ::= SEQUENCE {
	id			Biostruc-id,
	descr			Biostruc-descr,
	history			Biostruc-history, 
	chemical-graph		Biostruc-graph,
	model-structure		SEQUENCE OF Biostruc-model }

-- A Biostruc-id is a collection identifiers for the molecular assembly.
-- mmdb-id's are NCBI-assigned, and are intended to be unique and stable 
-- identifiers.  Other-id's are synonyms.

Biostruc-id ::= SEQUENCE {
	mmdb-id			Mmdb-id,
	other-id		SEQUENCE OF Other-id OPTIONAL }

Mmdb-id ::= INTEGER

Other-id ::= CHOICE {
	integer-id		INTEGER,
	character-id		VisibleString }

-- The description of a biostruc refers to both the reported chemical and 
-- spatial structure of a biomolecular assembly.  PDB-derived descriptors
-- which refer specifically to the chemical components or spatial structure
-- are not provided here, but instead as descriptors of the biostruc-graph or 
-- biostruc-model. For PDB-derived structures the biostruc name is the PDB 
-- id-code.  PDB-derived citations appear as publications within the biostruc 
-- description.  Biostruc citations also include a data-submission citation 
-- derived from PDB AUTHOR records.  Citations are described using the NCBI
-- Pub-set specification, which is not repeated here.

EXPORTS Biostruc-graph, Molecule-id, Residue-id, Atom-id;

-- A biostruc graph contains the complete chemical graph of the biomolecular 
-- assembly.  The assembly graph is defined hierarchically, in terms of 
-- subgraphs graphs of component molecules.  For PDB-derived biostrucs,
-- the molecules forming the assembly are the individual biopolymer chains and 
-- any non-polymer or "heterogen" groups which are present. 

-- The PDB-derived  "compound name" field appears as the name within the
-- biostruc-graph description.  PDB "class" and "source" fields appear as 
-- explicit attributes.  PDB-derived structures are assigned an assembly type 
-- of "other" unless they have been further classified.  If they have, the 
-- source of the type classification appears as a citation within the 
-- assembly description. 

-- Note that the biostruc-graph also includes as literals the subgraphs of 
-- any nonstandard residues present within it. For PDB-derived biostrucs these 
-- subgraphs are constructed automatically, with validation as described below.

Biostruc-graph ::= SEQUENCE {
	descr			Biomol-descr,
	pdb-class		VisibleString OPTIONAL,
	pdb-source		VisibleString OPTIONAL,
	type			ENUMERATED {
					physiological-form(1),

	molecule-graphs		SEQUENCE OF Molecule-graph,
	inter-molecule-bonds	SEQUENCE OF Inter-residue-bond OPTIONAL,
	residue-graphs		SEQUENCE OF Residue-graph OPTIONAL }

-- A biomolecule description refers to the chemical structure of a molecule or 
-- component substructures.  This descriptor type is used at the level of
-- assemblies, molecules and residues, and also for residue-graph dictionaries.
-- The Org-ref object type is drawn from NCBI taxonomy data specifications,
-- and is not repeated here.

Biomol-descr ::= SEQUENCE {
	name			VisibleString,
	comments		SEQUENCE OF VisibleString OPTIONAL,
	organism		Org-ref OPTIONAL,
	attribution		Pub-set OPTIONAL }

-- A molecule chemical graph is defined by a sequence of residues.  Nonpolymers
-- are described in the same way, but may contain only a single residue.  

-- Biopolymer molecules are identified within PDB entries according to their
-- appearance on SEQRES records, which formally define a biopolymer as such. 
-- Biopolymers are defined by the distinction between ATOM and HETATM 
-- coordinate records only in cases where the chemical sequence from SEQRES
-- is in conflict with coordinate data. The PDB-assigned chain code appears as 
-- the name within the molecule descriptions of the biopolymers.

-- Nonpolymer molecules from PDB correspond to individual HETEROGEN groups, 
-- excluding any HETEROGEN groups which represent modified biopolymer residues.
-- These molecules are named according to the chain, residue type and residue 
-- number fields as assigned by PDB. Any description appearing in the PDB HET 
-- record appear as a comment within the molecule description. 

-- Molecule types for PDB-derived molecule graphs are assigned by matching 
-- residue and atom names against the PDB-documented standard types for protein,
-- DNA and RNA, and against residue codes commonly-used to indicate solvent.
-- Classification is by "majority rule". If more than half of the residues in
-- a biopolymer are standard groups of one type, then the molecule is of that type,
-- and otherwise classified as "other". Note that this classification does not 
-- preclude the presence of modified residues, but insists they constitute 
-- less than half the biopolymer. Non-polymers are classified only as "solvent"
-- or "other".  

-- Note that a molecule graph may also contain a set of cross references 
-- to other databases, in particular to a biopolymer sequence database.  All
-- biopolymer molecules in MMDB contain appropriate identifiers for the 
-- corresponding entry in the NCBI-Sequences database, in particular the
-- NCBI "gi" number, which may be used for sequence retrieval. The Seq-id
-- object type is defined in the NCBI molecular sequence specification, and
-- not repeated here.

Residue-id ::= INTEGER

-- Residue graphs from different sources may be referenced within a molecule

-- A residue dictionary contains a collection of standard residue graphs.
-- The standard residue graph dictionary supplied with the MMDB database 
-- contains 20 standard L amino acids and 8 standard ribonucleotide groups. 
-- These graphs are complete, including explicit hydrogen atoms and separate 
-- instances for the terminal polypeptide and polynucleotide residues. 

Residue-graph-dictionary ::= SEQUENCE {
	id			Dictionary-id,
	descr			Biomol-descr,
	residue-graphs		SEQUENCE OF Residue-graph }

Dictionary-id ::= INTEGER

-- Residue graphs define atomic formulae, connectivity, chirality, and names.
-- For standard residue graphs from the MMDB dictionary the PDB-assigned 
-- residue-type code appears as the name within the residue graph description,
-- and the full trivial name of the residue as a comment within that 
-- description.  For any nonstandard residue graphs provided with an MMDB 
-- biostruc the PDB-assigned residue-type code similarly appears as the name 
-- within the description, and any information provided on PDB HET records as 
-- a comment within that description.  

-- Note that nonstandard residue graphs for a PDB-derived biostruc may be 
-- incomplete. Current PDB format cannot represent connectivity for groups 
-- which are disordered, and for which no coordinates are given.  In these 
-- cases the residue graph defined in MMDB represents only the subgraph that 
-- could be identified from available ATOM, HETATM and CONECT records.

Residue-graph-id ::= INTEGER

-- Atoms in residue graphs are defined by elemental symbols and names.  PDB-
-- assigned atom names appear here in the name field, except in cases of known 
-- PDB synonyms.  In these cases atom names are mapped to the names used in the
-- MMDB standard dictionary. This occurs primarily for hydrogen atoms, where 
-- PDB practice allows synonyms for several atom types.  For PDB atoms the 
-- elemental symbol is obtained by parsing the PDB atom name field, allowing 
-- for known special-semantics cases where the atom name does not follow the
-- documented encoding rule.  Ionizable protons are identified within standard 
-- residue graphs in the MMDB dictionary, but not within automatically-defined
-- nonstandard graphs.

Atom-id ::= INTEGER

-- Intra-residue-bond specifies connectivity between atoms in Residue-graph.
-- Unlike Inter-residue-bond defined later, its participating atoms are part of a
-- residue subgraph dictionary, not part of a specific biostruc-graph.

-- For residue graphs in the standard MMDB dictionary bonds are defined from
-- the known chemical structures of amino acids and nucleotides.  For 
-- nonstandard residue graphs bonds are defined from PDB CONECT records, with
-- validation for consistency with coordinate data, and from stereochemical
-- calculation to identify unreported bonds.  Validation and bond identification
-- are based on comparison of inter-atomic distances to the sum of covalent
-- radii for the corresponding elements. 

Intra-residue-bond ::= SEQUENCE {
	atom-id-1		Atom-id,
	atom-id-2		Atom-id,
	bond-order		ENUMERATED {
					single(1), 
					partial-double(2),

					other(6),
					unknown(255)} OPTIONAL }

-- Chiral centers are atoms with tetrahedral geometry.  Chirality is defined
-- by a chiral volume involving the chiral center and 3 other atoms bonded to 
-- it.  For any coordinates assigned to atoms c, n1, n2, and n3, the vector 
-- triple product (n1-c) dot ( (n2-c) cross (n3-c) ) must have the indicated
-- sign.  The calculation assumes an orthogonal right-handed coordinate system
-- as is used for MMDB model structures.  

-- Chirality is defined for standard residues in the MMDB dictionary, but is 
-- not assigned automatically for PDB-derived nonstandard residues. If assigned
-- for nonstandard residues, the source of chirality information is described 
-- by a citation within the residue description.

Chiral-center ::= SEQUENCE {
	c			Atom-id,
	n1			Atom-id,
	n2			Atom-id,
	n3			Atom-id,
	sign			ENUMERATED { positive(1),
					     negative(2) } }

-- Formal charge describes the ionization state and/or oxidation state of
-- nonpolymer groups.  Units are the difference in the number of electrons
-- present relative to the number required to formally neutralize nuclear
-- charge.  Formal charge is defined for residues in the MMDB standard
-- dictionary, but not for nonstandards.

Formal-charge ::= INTEGER

-- Inter-residue bonds are defined by a reference to two atoms. For PDB-derived 
-- structures bonds are identified from biopolymer connectivity according to
-- SEQRES and from other connectivity information from SSBOND and CONECT 
-- records. These data are validated and unreported bonds identified by
-- stereochemical calculation, using the same criteria as for intra-residue 
-- bonds, are also included.
