INSD-Seq DEFINITIONS ::=
BEGIN

--********
--  INSD-Seq represents the elements in a GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ style report
--    of a sequence with some small additions to structure and support
--    for protein (GenPept) versions of flatfile format as seen in Entrez.
--    While this represents the simplification, reduction of detail, and
--    flattening to a single sequence perspective of the three flatfile
--    formats, it is presented in ASN.1 or XML for automated parsing and
--    processing. It is hoped that this compromise will be useful for
--    those bulk processing at the flatfile format level of detail today.
--    Since itis a compromise, a number of pragmatic decisions have been
--    made.
--
--  In pursuit of simplicity and familiarity a number of fields do not
--    have full substructure defined here where there is already a
--    standard flatfile format string. For example:
--
--    Date  DD-Mon-YYYY
--    Authors   LastName, Intials (with periods)
--   Journal   JounalName Volume (issue), page-range (year)
--   FeatureLocations as per flatfile feature table, but FeatureIntervals
--    may also be provided as a convenience
--   FeatureQualifiers  as per flatfile feature table
--   Primary has a string that represents a table to construct
--    a third party (TPA) sequence.
--   other-seqids can have strings with the "vertical bar format" sequence
--    identifiers used in BLAST for example, when they are non-genbank types.
--    Currently in flatfile format you only see GI, but there are others, like
--    patents, submitter clone names, etc which will appear here, as they
--    always have in the ASN.1 format, and full XML format.
--   source-db is a formatted text block for peptides in GenPept format that
--    carries information from the source protein database.
--
--  There are also a number of elements that could have been more exactly
--   specified, but in the interest of simplicity have been simply left as
--   options. For example:
--
--  accession and accession.version will always appear in a public record
--   they are optional because this format can also be used for non-public
--   sequences, and in that case will have only "other-seqids".
--
--  sequences will normally all have "sequence" filled in. But contig records
--    will have a "join" statement in the "contig" slot, and no "sequence".
--    We also may consider a retrieval option with no sequence of any kind
--     and no feature table to quickly check minimal values.
--
--  a reference may have an author list, or be from a consortium, or both.
--
--  some fields, such as taxonomy, do appear as separate elements in flatfile
--    format but without a specific linetype (in GenBank format this comes
--    under ORGANISM). Another example is the separation of primary accession
--    from the list of secondary accessions. In flatfile format primary
--    accession is just the first one on the list that includes all secondaries
--    after it.
--
--  create-date deserves special comment. The date you see on the right hand
--    side of the LOCUS line in GenBank format is actually the last date the
--    the record was modified (or the update-date). The date the record was
--    first submitted to the databases appears in the first submission citation
--    in the reference section. Internally in the databases and ASN.1 NCBI keeps
--    the first date the record was released into the sequence database at
--    NCBI as create-date. For records from EMBL, which supports create-date,
--    it is the date provided by EMBL. For DDBJ records, which do not supply
--    a create-date (same as GenBank format) the create-date is the first date
--    NCBI saw the record from DDBJ. For older GenBank records, before NCBI
--    took responsibility for GenBank, it is just the first date NCBI saw the
--    record. Create-date can be very useful, so we expose it here, but users
--    must understand it is only an approximation and comes from many sources,
--    and with many exceptions and caveats. It does NOT tell you the first
--    date the public might have seen this record and thus is NOT an accurate
--    measure for legal issues of precedence.
