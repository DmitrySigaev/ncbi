* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* $Log$
* Revision 1.9  2003/10/13 05:21:01  vakatov
* Rollback previous revision, it caused a bug (again; this time
* on output); to be fixed later.
*
* Revision 1.5  2001/10/15 18:26:32  ucko
* Implement sync; fix a typo
*
* Revision 1.4  1999/10/21 14:50:49  sandomir
* optimization for overflow() (internal buffer added)
*
* Revision 1.3  1999/06/08 21:36:29  vakatov
* #HAVE_NO_CHAR_TRAITS::  use "CT_XXX_TYPE" instead of "xxx_type" for
* xxx = { "int", "char", "pos", "off" }
*
* Revision 1.2  1999/04/28 16:54:19  vasilche
* Implemented stream input processing for FastCGI applications.
*
* Revision 1.1  1999/04/27 14:49:49  vasilche
* Added FastCGI interface.
* CNcbiContext renamed to CCgiContext.
