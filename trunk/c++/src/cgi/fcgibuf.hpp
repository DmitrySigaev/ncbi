/*
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.8  2003/10/09 20:57:06  lavr
 * Bugfixes for the attempt to make I/O buffers fully buffered on top
 * of respective implementations of FCGI buffers in the FCGI library
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/10/07 14:40:28  lavr
 * CCgiIBuffer: made buffered on internal FGCX_Stream storage
 * CCgiOBuffer: buffering is done entirely on internal FGCX_Stream storage
 * Log moved to end; guard macro standardized
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/10/15 18:26:32  ucko
 * Implement sync; fix a typo
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1999/10/21 14:50:49  sandomir
 * optimization for overflow() (internal buffer added)
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1999/06/08 21:36:29  vakatov
 * #HAVE_NO_CHAR_TRAITS::  use "CT_XXX_TYPE" instead of "xxx_type" for
 * xxx = { "int", "char", "pos", "off" }
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1999/04/28 16:54:19  vasilche
 * Implemented stream input processing for FastCGI applications.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1999/04/27 14:49:49  vasilche
 * Added FastCGI interface.
 * CNcbiContext renamed to CCgiContext.
