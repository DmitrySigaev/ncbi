<h3><a name="enable"></a>Enable editor</h3>
Turns on the editor, allowing you to change the alignment.
<h3><a name="undo"></a>Undo</h3>
Undo the latest operation; Ctrl+Z has the same effect as this menu item. All operations
(the items under this <b>Edit</b> menu) that change the alignment are undoable.
<h3><a name="split_block"></a>Split block</h3>
To split an aligned block, select this item then move the mouse over the block
to be split and click once. The block under the mouse will be split such that
the new (rightmost) block will start at the column under the mouse.
<h3><a name="merge_block"></a>Merge block</h3>
To merge two or more adjacent aligned blocks, select this item then click and
drag the mouse across the blocks to be merged. These blocks will then be joined
into a single large block.
<h3><a name="create_block"></a>Create block</h3>
To create a new block, select this item then click and drag the mouse across columns
of unaligned residues where you would like a new block to be created. Note that
all columns of the alignment in the selected area must contain residues (no unaligned
gaps).
<h3><a name="delete_block"></a>Delete block</h3>
To delete a block, select this item and then click on any aligned block. That
block will be removed and the residues marked unaligned.
<h3><a name="sync"></a>Sync structure colors</h3>
<h3><a name="always_sync"></a>Always sync structure colors</h3>
Because the alignments are color-coded, changes to the alignment can cause changes
in color of structures in the alignment. By default, <b>Always sync structure
colors</b> is on, which means this redrawing of structures will take place automatically.
This can be turned off for slower computers where redraws take a long time; use
<b>Sync structure colors </b> to manually redraw the structures with any new colors.
<h3><a name="sort"></a>Sort rows</h3>
<p>Use this item to sort the slave rows of the current alignment. The algorithms
  available for sorting are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>By identifier</b>: sort so 
  that all PDB identifiers are at the top of the list in alphabetical order, 
  followed by all non-PDB's sorted by numerical order for gi's or alphabetical 
  order for accessions. 
  <li><b>By score</b>: sort by 
  PSSM+contact score. You will be prompted for a weight between these two, then 
  rows will be sorted with the highest scoring rows at the top. The scores will 
  also be displayed in the status line when you move the mouse over each 
  sequence. 
  <li><b>Float PDBs</b>: simply moves 
  all PDB sequences to the top of the alignment, but without otherwise changing 
  the relative ordering of the PDB sequence or non-structured rows. 
  <li><b>Float highlights</b>: floats any sequences that contain highlights
  to the top of the alignment.
  <li><b>Self-hit</b>: sorts by BLAST score between each sequence and the PSSM
constructed from the current alignment.
  <li><b>Proximity sort</b>: select this menu item and then click on any but the
    master sequence to do a proximity sort. This will move the selected sequence
    to a position in the alignment according to its relative sequence conservation
    with the master sequence. Then the other sequences most similar to the selected
    row will be clustered around it. This is useful for grouping similar sequences
    together, and for automatically finding similar sequences in a large alignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="delete_row"></a>Delete row</h3>
Select this item and then click on any but the master sequence to remove that
row from the alignment.
