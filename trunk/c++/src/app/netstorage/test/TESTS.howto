This is how-to to run tests.

1. Source code / binary

The tests are developed for the NetStorage API, not specifically for the server.
They however could be used to test the server. The source code could be found
here:
https://svn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/viewvc/toolkit/trunk/c++/src/misc/netstorage/test/

A binary could be taken from regular builds, e.g.:
/netopt/ncbi_tools64/c++.current/GCC-Release/bin/test_netstorage.gz


2. Setup

The test_netstorage binary does not provide command line arguments to control
its behavior. Neither it provides a description of what is recognized in its
.ini file. By default the test uses the ST_Test service (at least at the time
of writing). Here is a description of how to create a setup for your own
instance of the NetStorage server.

2.1 Run the server, and note the host and port, e.g. iebdev22:9800
2.2 Create test_netstorage.ini as follows:


; The service S is to be used instead of the default service.
; The service name S is faked and mentioned twice because the test_netstorage
; changed what parameter/section is recognized. To be on the safe side the
; service is provided twice.
[netstorage]
service_name=S

[netstorage_api]
service_name=S


; The service S is not advertized by the LBSMD daemon and LBSMD is running in a
; passive mode on the developers hosts and thus changes in the LBSMD
; configuration files would not help. There is a way however to override the
; service resolution procedure. This is how to do that (two sections below):
[CONN]
LOCAL_ENABLE=1

[S]
CONN_LOCAL_SERVER_0="STANDALONE iebdev22:9800 L=yes"


3. Running

Run the test_netstorage having its .ini file in the same directory.
Most probably the test suite should be restricted:

$ ./test_netstorage -t 'TestNetStorage*'





Tip: how to time a query in MS SQL Server Management Studio

DECLARE @StartTime datetime,@EndTime datetime   
SELECT @StartTime=GETDATE() 

-- Your query comes here, e.g. call the GetStatInfo stored procedure
EXEC GetStatInfo

SELECT @EndTime=GETDATE()   
SELECT DATEDIFF(ms,@StartTime,@EndTime) AS [Duration in milliseconds]
