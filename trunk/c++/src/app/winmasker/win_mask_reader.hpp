 * Revision 1.1  2005/02/25 21:32:55  dicuccio
 * Rearranged winmasker files:
 * - move demo/winmasker to a separate app directory (src/app/winmasker)
 * - move win_mask_* to app directory
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/02/12 19:58:04  dicuccio
 * Corrected file type issues introduced by CVS (trailing return).  Updated
 * typedef names to match C++ coding standard.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/02/12 19:15:11  dicuccio
 * Initial version - ported from Aleksandr Morgulis's tree in internal/winmask
