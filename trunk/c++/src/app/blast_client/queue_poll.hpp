/// Queueing and Polling code for blast_client.

/// This contains the interface of queueing and polling code for blast_client.
/// There is only one function interface.  The goal of this interface is to
/// seperate the computational / network code from the UI (CNcbiApplication).

/// Queue the request with the given parameters; poll and display the results.
///
/// This function does the bulk of the work for the blast_client program.  It
/// queues the search, waits for processing, retrieves the results, and
/// displays the output.
/// @param program       Program to run (e.g. blastp, blastn...).
/// @param service       Service to run (e.g. plain, rpsblast, megablast...).
/// @param database      Database to search (nr, nt, pdb, etc).
/// @param opts          Optional netblast parameters.
/// @param verbose       Debugging output - displays netblast socket traffic.
/// @param trust_defline Assume sequence and defline are consistent with db.
/// @param raw_asn       Display text ASN.1, not formatted output.
/// @param alparms       Parameters to control output formatting.
