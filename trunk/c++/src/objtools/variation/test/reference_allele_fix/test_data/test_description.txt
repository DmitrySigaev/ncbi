 1.asn | Correct reference allele SNP
 2.asn | SNP with swapped alleles
 3.asn | SNP without reference to begin with in allele set
 4.asn | Fully shifted insertion (no reference to fix, as this is an insertion)
 5.asn | Fully shifted deletion with correct allele deleted
 6.asn | Fully shifted deletion, but with incorrect allele
 7.asn | Deletion, not shifted, with incorrect allele
 8.asn | MNP, with correct deletion
 9.asn | MNP with incorrect deletion
 10.asn | Intronic SNV where sequence is not in first delta-item
 11.asn | Identity Variation-inst in a set returns appropriate type
