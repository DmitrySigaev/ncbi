 *     are be-md domain on dev machine),
 *   - somewhere else (set in registry with [CONN]lbos)
 * You can set priority for the first place to try. If LBOS is not found in
 * this primary location, then it will be searched for in other places
 * following default algorithm of going through places (maybe even through
 * the same place again).                                                    */
