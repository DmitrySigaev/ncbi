 * $Log$
 * Revision 6.2  2006/02/15 19:48:34  didenko
 * Added new optional config parameter "reuse_job_object" which allows reusing
 * IWorkerNodeJob objects in the jobs' threads instead of creating
 * a new object for each job.
 *
 * Revision 6.1  2006/02/15 15:19:03  didenko
 * Implemented an optional possibility for a worker node to have a permanent connection
 * to a NetSchedule server.
 * To expedite the job exchange between a worker node and a NetSchedule server,
 * a call to CNetScheduleClient::PutResult method is replaced to a
 * call to CNetScheduleClient::PutResultGetJob method.
