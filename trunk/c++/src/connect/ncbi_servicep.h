 * File Description:
 *   Private API to define server iterator structure.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * $Log$
 * Revision 6.4  2000/10/20 17:22:55  lavr
 * VTable changed to have 'Update' method
 * 'SERV_Update' added to private interface
 *
 * Revision 6.3  2000/10/05 21:37:51  lavr
 * Mapper-specific private data field added
 *
 * Revision 6.2  2000/05/22 16:53:12  lavr
 * Rename service_info -> server_info everywhere (including
 * file names) as the latter name is more relevant
 *
 * Revision 6.1  2000/05/12 18:38:16  lavr
 * First working revision
