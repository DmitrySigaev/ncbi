* File Description:  streambuf implementation for BLOBs
*
*
* $Log$
* Revision 1.3  2002/05/14 19:51:48  kholodov
* Fixed: incorrect column no handling for detecting end of column
*
* Revision 1.2  2002/05/13 19:11:53  kholodov
* Modified: added proper handling of EOFs while reading column data using CDB_Result::CurrentItemNo().
*
* Revision 1.1  2002/01/30 14:51:22  kholodov
* User DBAPI implementation, first commit
