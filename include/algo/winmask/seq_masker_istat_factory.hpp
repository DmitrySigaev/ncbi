/*
 * ========================================================================
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.4  2005/08/30 14:35:19  morgulis
 * NMer counts optimization using bit arrays. Performance is improved
 * by about 20%.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/04/13 13:47:48  dicuccio
 * Added export specifiers.  White space changes: reindented class body
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/04/12 13:35:34  morgulis
 * Support for binary format of unit counts file.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/04/04 14:28:46  morgulis
 * Decoupled reading and accessing unit counts information from seq_masker
 * core functionality and changed it to be able to support several unit
 * counts file formats.
