        The following structure is used in "link_hsps" to decide between

        a chain of HSP's (this is a VoidPtr as _blast_hsp is not yet
        defined), num is the number of links, and sum is the sum score.
        Once the best gapping model has been found, this information is
        transferred up to the BLAST_HSP.  This structure should not be
