/************************************************************************************

The following section has three sets of functions (or "APIs").  The first is to manipulate
an BlastHSP which is the basic unit to record one alignment.  The second is to manipulate a 
BlastHSPList, which is a list of BlastHSP's for one database sequence.  Finally there is the 
BlastHitList which is all the HSPList's for a given query.  The naming conventions for the 
functions are the following:

1.) All routines start with "Blast_"

2.) After "Blast_" comes the structure being manipulated, that should be either HSP (all capitals all the time!), HSPList (exactly this capitalization), or HitList (capital H and L, all others lower-case).

3.) finally the task being done, e.g., "Free", "New", "Init".
