/** @file blast_psi.hpp
 * C++ API for the PSI-BLAST PSSM generation engine.
 *
 * Notes:
 * Variants of PSI-BLAST:
 *     PSI-BLAST: protein/pssm vs. protein db/sequence
 *     PSI-TBLASTN: protein/pssm vs. translated nucleotide db/sequence
 *
 * Binaries which run the variants mentioned above as implemented in C toolkit:
 *     blastpgp runs PSI-BLAST (-j 1 = blastp; -j n, n>1 = PSI-BLAST)
 *     blastall runs PSI-TBLASTN and it is only possible to run with a PSSM 
 *     from checkpoint file via the -R option and for only one iteration.
 *     PSI-TBLASTN cannot be run from just an iteration, it is always product
 *     of a restart with a checkpoint file.

 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.8  2004/08/04 20:20:34  camacho
 * 1. Use CBlastScoreBlk instead of bare BlastScoreBlk pointer.
 * 2. Pass matrix name to properly populate Score_matrix::freq-Ratios field.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2004/08/02 13:28:04  camacho
 * +Initialization of BlastScoreBlk and population of Score_matrix structure
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2004/07/29 17:53:16  camacho
 * Redesigned to use strategy pattern
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2004/06/16 18:44:00  ucko
 * Make sure to supply full declarations for C(Const)Refs' parameters,
 * as forward declarations are not sufficient for all compilers.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/06/16 12:17:54  camacho
 * Fix for unit tests
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/06/08 22:27:44  camacho
 * Add missing doxygen comments
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/05/28 17:32:32  ucko
 * Remove redundant ncbi:: from specialization of CDeleter, as it
