 * Author:  Denis Vakatov
 *
 * File Description:
 *   Specifications to implement a connector("CONNECTOR") to be used to open
 *   and handle connection("CONN", see also in "ncbi_connection.[ch]") to an
 *   abstract i/o service.
 *   This is generally not for the public use. It is to be used in the modules
 *   that implement a particular connector.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * $Log$
 * Revision 6.6  2001/03/02 20:07:18  lavr
 * Typos fixed
 *
 * Revision 6.5  2001/01/11 16:39:33  lavr
 * FDestroy function is now clearly documented not to destroy
 * the connector itself, only its handle (private internal data).
 *
 * Revision 6.4  2001/01/03 22:29:22  lavr
 * Changed IOStatus -> Status
 *
 * Revision 6.3  2000/12/29 17:45:07  lavr
 * Heavily modified to have a stack of connectors
 * VTable format changed; all virtual function now accept CONNECTOR as a
 * first argument (not void* as in previous versions)
 *
 * Revision 6.2  2000/04/07 19:59:49  vakatov
 * Moved forward-declaration of CONNECTOR from "ncbi_connection.h"
 * to "ncbi_connector.h"
 *
 * Revision 6.1  2000/03/24 22:52:48  vakatov
 * Initial revision
