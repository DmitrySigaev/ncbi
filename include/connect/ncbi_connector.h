 * File Description:
 *   Specifications to implement a connector("CONNECTOR") to be used to open
 *   and handle connection("CONN", see also in "ncbi_connection.[ch]") to an
 *   abstract i/o service.
 *   This is generally not for the public use. It is to be used in the modules
 *   that implement a particular connector.
