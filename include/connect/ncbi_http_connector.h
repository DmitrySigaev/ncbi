/* Create new CONNECTOR structure to hit the specified URL using HTTP
 * with either POST or GET method.
 * Use the configuration values recorded in "info". If "info" is NULL, then
 * use the default info (created by "ConnNetInfo_Create(0)").
 *
 * In order to workaround some HTTP communication features, this code will:
 *  1) Accumulate all output data in an internal memory buffer until the
 *     first "Read" (or "Peek", or "Close", or "Wait" on read) is attempted.
 *  2) On the first "Read" (or "Peek", or "Close", or "Wait" on read), compose
 *     and send the whole HTTP request as:
 *        {POST|GET} <info->path>?<info->args> HTTP/1.0\r\n
 *        <user_header\r\n>
 *        Content-Length: <accumulated_data_length>\r\n
 *        \r\n
 *        <accumulated_data>
 *     NOTE:
 *       if <user->header> is not a NULL or empty string, then:
 *       - it must NOT contain "empty lines":  '\n\r\n';
 *       - it must be terminated by a single '\r\n';
 *       - it gets inserted to the HTTP header "as is", without any
 *         automatic checking or encoding.
 *  3) Now you can "Read" the reply data sent to you by the peer CGI program.
 *  4) Then, if you "Write" again then the connection to the peer CGI program
 *     will be forcibly closed, and you cannot communicate with it anymore
 *     (the peer CGI process will die).
 *
 *  *) But if "fHCC_AutoReconnect" is set in "flags", then the connector will
 *     make an automatic reconnect to the same CGI script with just the
 *     same parameters, and you can repeat the (1,2,3) micro-session with
 *     another instance of your peer CGI program.
 *
 *     If "fHCC_AutoReconnect" is not set then only one
 *     "Write ... Write Read ... Read" micro-session is allowed, and the next
 *     try to "Write" will fail with error status "eIO_Closed".
 *
 *  Other flags:
 *
 *  fHCC_SureFlush --
 *       make the connector to send at least the HTTP header on "CLOSE" and
 *       re-"CONNECT", even if no data was written
 *  fHCC_KeepHeader --
 *       do not strip HTTP header (i.e. everything up to the first "\r\n\r\n",
 *       including the "\r\n\r\n") from the CGI script's response
 *  fHCC_UrlDecodeInput --
 *       strip the HTTP header from the input data;  assume the input
 *       data are single-part, URL-encoded;  perform the URL-decoding on read
 *       NOTE:  this flag disables the "fHCC_KeepHeader" flag
 *
 * NOTE: the URL encoding/decoding (in the "fHCC_Url_*" cases and "info->args")
 *       is performed by URL_Encode() and URL_Decode() -- "ncbi_connutil.[ch]".
