 * $Log$
 * Revision 6.3  2000/03/24 23:12:04  vakatov
 * Starting the development quasi-branch to implement CONN API.
 * All development is performed in the NCBI C++ tree only, while
 * the NCBI C tree still contains "frozen" (see the last revision) code.
 *
 * Revision 6.2  2000/02/23 22:33:38  vakatov
 * Can work both "standalone" and as a part of NCBI C++ or C toolkits
 *
 * Revision 6.1  1999/10/18 15:36:39  vakatov
 * Initial revision (derived from the former "ncbisock.[ch]")

 *  Multi-Thread safety
 *
 * If you are using this API in a multi-thread application, and there is
 * more than one thread using this API, it is safe to call SOCK_InitializeAPI()
 * explicitely in the beginning of your main thread, before you run any other
 * threads, and to call SOCK_ShutdownAPI() after all threads are exited.
 *
 * As soon as the API is initialized it becomes relatively MT-safe, however
 * you still must not operate with the same LSOCK or SOCK objects from
 * different threads simultaneously.
 *
 * A MUCH BETTER WAY of dealing with this issue is to provide your own MT
 * locking callback (see CORE_SetLOCK in "ncbi_core.h"). This will also
 * guarantee the proper MT protection should some other SOCK functions
 * start to access any static data in the future.
