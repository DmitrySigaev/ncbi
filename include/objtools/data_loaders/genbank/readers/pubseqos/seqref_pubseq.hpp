/*
* $Log$
* Revision 1.1  2003/12/30 22:14:41  vasilche
* Updated genbank loader and readers plugins.
*
* Revision 1.11  2003/10/21 14:27:35  vasilche
* Added caching of gi -> sat,satkey,version resolution.
* SNP blobs are stored in cache in preprocessed format (platform dependent).
* Limit number of connections to GenBank servers.
* Added collection of ID1 loader statistics.
*
* Revision 1.10  2003/09/30 16:22:01  vasilche
* Updated internal object manager classes to be able to load ID2 data.
* SNP blobs are loaded as ID2 split blobs - readers convert them automatically.
* Scope caches results of requests for data to data loaders.
* Optimized CSeq_id_Handle for gis.
* Optimized bioseq lookup in scope.
* Reduced object allocations in annotation iterators.
* CScope is allowed to be destroyed before other objects using this scope are
* deleted (feature iterators, bioseq handles etc).
* Optimized lookup for matching Seq-ids in CSeq_id_Mapper.
* Added 'adaptive' option to objmgr_demo application.
*
* Revision 1.9  2003/08/27 14:24:43  vasilche
* Simplified CCmpTSE class.
*
* Revision 1.8  2003/08/14 20:05:18  vasilche
* Simple SNP features are stored as table internally.
* They are recreated when needed using CFeat_CI.
*
* Revision 1.7  2003/07/24 20:36:48  vasilche
* Fixed includes.
*
* Revision 1.6  2003/07/24 19:28:08  vasilche
* Implemented SNP split for ID1 loader.
*
* Revision 1.5  2003/07/17 20:07:55  vasilche
* Reduced memory usage by feature indexes.
* SNP data is loaded separately through PUBSEQ_OS.
* String compression for SNP data.
*
* Revision 1.4  2003/06/02 16:01:37  dicuccio
* Rearranged include/objects/ subtree.  This includes the following shifts:
*     - include/objects/alnmgr --> include/objtools/alnmgr
*     - include/objects/cddalignview --> include/objtools/cddalignview
*     - include/objects/flat --> include/objtools/flat
*     - include/objects/objmgr/ --> include/objmgr/
*     - include/objects/util/ --> include/objmgr/util/
*     - include/objects/validator --> include/objtools/validator
*
* Revision 1.3  2003/04/15 16:31:37  dicuccio
* Placed CResultBtSrcRdr in XOBJMGR Win32 export namespace (was
* erroneously in XUTIL)
*
* Revision 1.2  2003/04/15 15:30:14  vasilche
* Added include <memory> when needed.
* Removed buggy buffer in printing methods.
* Removed unnecessary include of stream_util.hpp.
*
* Revision 1.1  2003/04/15 14:24:08  vasilche
* Changed CReader interface to not to use fake streams.
