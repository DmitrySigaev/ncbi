*     - include/objects/cddalignview --> include/objtools/cddalignview
*     - include/objects/flat --> include/objtools/flat
*     - include/objects/objmgr/ --> include/objmgr/
*     - include/objects/util/ --> include/objmgr/util/
*     - include/objects/validator --> include/objtools/validator
*
* Revision 1.8  2002/12/26 20:42:55  dicuccio
* Added Win32 export specifier.  Removed unimplemented (private) operator++(int)
*
