* Limit number of connections to GenBank servers.
* Added collection of ID1 loader statistics.
*
* Revision 1.4  2003/10/15 13:43:57  vasilche
* Removed obsolete class CResultZBtSrc.
* Some code formatting.
*
* Revision 1.3  2003/10/14 22:35:09  ucko
* Add missing declaration of CResultZBtSrcRdr::GetCompressedSize.
*
* Revision 1.2  2003/07/24 20:41:43  vasilche
* Added private constructor to make MSVC-DLL happy.
*
* Revision 1.1  2003/07/24 19:28:08  vasilche
* Implemented SNP split for ID1 loader.
