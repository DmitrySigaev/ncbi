* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* $Log$
* Revision 1.4  2000/06/07 19:45:54  vasilche
* Some code cleaning.
* Macros renaming in more clear way.
* BEGIN_NAMED_*_INFO, ADD_*_MEMBER, ADD_NAMED_*_MEMBER.
*
* Revision 1.3  2000/05/24 20:08:30  vasilche
* Implemented DTD generation.
*
* Revision 1.2  2000/04/07 19:26:07  vasilche
* Added namespace support to datatool.
* By default with argument -oR datatool will generate objects in namespace
* NCBI_NS_NCBI::objects (aka ncbi::objects).
* Datatool's classes also moved to NCBI namespace.
*
* Revision 1.1  2000/02/01 21:46:15  vasilche
* Added CGeneratedChoiceTypeInfo for generated choice classes.
* Removed CMemberInfo subclasses.
* Added support for DEFAULT/OPTIONAL members.
* Changed class generation.
* Moved datatool headers to include/internal/serial/tool.
*
* Revision 1.2  1999/12/28 18:55:57  vasilche
* Reduced size of compiled object files:
* 1. avoid inline or implicit virtual methods (especially destructors).
* 2. avoid std::string's methods usage in inline methods.
* 3. avoid string literals ("xxx") in inline methods.
*
* Revision 1.1  1999/12/03 21:42:11  vasilche
* Fixed conflict of enums in choices.
