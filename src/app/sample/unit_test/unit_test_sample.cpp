* Author:  Pavel Ivanov, NCBI
*
* File Description:
*   Sample unit test with auto-registration of test cases.
*
* If you don't want to use auto-registration of test cases or you want to use
* some features that are not available with auto-registration
* (e.g. initialization code before all tests or dependencies between tests)
* look into another sample - unit_test_alt_sample.cpp.
*
* NOTE:
*   Boost.Test reports some memory leaks when compiled in MSVC even for this
*   simple code. Maybe it's related to some toolkit static variables.
*   To avoid annoying messages about memory leaks run this program with
*   parameter --detect_memory_leak=0
