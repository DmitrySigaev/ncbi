<h3><a name="titles"></a>Show titles</h3>
Causes the titles for each sequence to be displayed on the left side of the window.
These are on by default, but can be turned off by double-clicking the black separator
bar.
<h3><a name="geometry"></a>Show geometry violations</h3>
Shows in green background the places where a loop between aligned blocks is calculated
to be too short to span the distance between the <span lang="en-us"></span>ends of these blocks, based
on the coordinates of the master structure.
<h3><a name="pattern"></a>Find pattern</h3>
Finds and highlights all non-overlapping occurrences of a residue pattern. This
search uses ProSite syntax, described in detail at http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/
- see the description of the PA (pattern) syntax. For example, to search for lysine
separated by two to four residues from histidine, enter "k-x(2,4)-h";
unlike ProSite, the letters are case-insensitive, and a trailing period is not
required.
<h3><a name="showhide"></a>Show / hide rows</h3>
Show or hide specific rows of the alignment. All rows selected in the dialog will
be displayed. Note that because of the way Cn3D combines pairwise alignments,
especially when these alignments are very different (like from a VAST "multiple"
alignment of three or more proteins), when you hide rows the alignment of the
other rows may change. See the Cn3D Tutorial for more on this topic.
<h3><a name="scores"></a>Show PSSM + contact scores</h3>
Calculate and display scores for each row based on alignment (PSSM) and contact
potential (structure-based) scores. You can specify what balance between PSSM
and contact potential to use. These values will then be displayed in the status
line at the bottom of the window when you move the mouse over each row.
<h3><a name="selfhit"></a>Show self-hits</h3>
Calculates a BLAST alignment for each sequence in the current alignment, using
the PSSM constructed from the alignment, and restricting the alignment of each
sequence to its currently aligned range. Shows scores for each row, and
the percentage of rows that score significantly with the alignment's PSSM.
<h3><a name="export"></a>Export</h3>
<p>Used to export the current alignment in one of three formats: <b>FASTA</b> 
(with gaps), <b>a2m FASTA</b>, <b>text</b>, or <b>HTML</b> (with color).</p>
<h3><a name="taxonomy"></a>Show taxonomy</h3>
Connects to the NCBI taxonomy server, and constructs the subset of the global 
taxonomy tree that includes all sequences from the current alignment. In the 
resulting taxonomy tree window, selecting a node and pressing space or return
will cause that node to be completely collapsed or expanded. Double-clicking
on a sequence node will highlight that sequence in the sequence window.
