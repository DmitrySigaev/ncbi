// This is the generic interface to a viewable alignment; it provides a minimal
// set of functions that are required to build the display. Any objects to be
// displayed in the SequenceViewerWidget must be derived from ViewableAlignment,
// and must implement these functions.

    // should set the overall size of the display, in columns (width) and rows (height)

    // the title area will be left blank.
    virtual bool GetRowTitle(int row, wxString *title, wxColour *color) const = 0;

    // should set the character and its traits to display at the given location;
    // both columns and rows are numbered from zero. If the return value is false,
    // the cell for this character will be left blank. If drawBackground is true,
    // then the cell's background will be redrawn with the given color (e.g.,
    // for highlights).
    virtual bool GetCharacterTraitsAt(int column, int row,      // location
        char *character,                                        // character to draw
        wxColour *color,                                        // color of this character

    ///// be overridden to provide some user-defined behaviour on these events /////

    // this is called when the mouse is moved over a cell; (-1,-1) means
    // the mouse is not over the character grid. This is only called called once
    // when the mouse enters a cell, or leaves the grid - it is not repeated if
    // the mouse is dragged around inside a single cell.
    virtual void MouseOver(int column, int row) const { }

    // these are used in the the following feedback functions to tell whether
    // control keys were down at the time of (the beginning of) selection. The
    // 'controls' item may be any bitwise combination of the following:
    enum eControlKeys {
        eShiftDown      = 0x01,
        eControlDown    = 0x02,
        eAltOrMetaDown  = 0x04
    };

    // this is called when the mouse-down event occurs (i.e., at the
    // beginning of selection), saying where the mouse was at the time and
    // with what control keys (see eControlKeys above). If 'false' is returned,
    // then no selection will ensue; if 'true', selection acts normally.
    virtual bool MouseDown(int column, int row, unsigned int controls) { return true; }

    // this is the callback when the the widget is in eSelect mode; it gives the
    // corners of the rectangle of cells selected.
    virtual void SelectedRectangle(
        int columnLeft, int rowTop, 
        int columnRight, int rowBottom) { }

    // this is the callback when the widget is in eDrag mode; it gives two cells,
    // one where the mouse button-down occurred, and one where mouse-up occurred.

// This is the GUI class itself. It is a wxSplitterWindow - a viewing area where
// characters are drawn, with right and bottom scrollbars that will automatically
// be added if necessary. Note that it is *not* a complete top-level window!
// Thus, it can be embedded in other windows, and more than one can exist in a window.
// If you want a separate top-level sequence viewing window, then simply put this
// object into a wxFrame (with whatever menus you want to attach to it).

// A note on memory and processor efficiency: the SequenceViewerWidget does *not*
// keep an entire array of characters in memory, nor does it keep a canvas of the
// entire pixel image of the alignment in memory, thus it should be able to display
// large alignments without incurring NxN memory usage. However, this means that
// the display must be created dynamically, by calls to the ViewableAlignment's
// member functions, as appropriate. It only calls these functions on the
// minimum number of positions needed to fill out the display, including on
// scrolling operations: if you scroll the view one column to the right, only
// the rightmost column is redrawn, and thus the number of calls to GetCharacterAt()
// is equal only to the number of rows in the visible region. Hopefully this will
// provide a reasonable compromise between memory and CPU efficiency.
