class ViewableAlignment;

// This is the GUI class itself. It is a wxSplitterWindow - a viewing area where
// characters are drawn, with right and bottom scrollbars that will automatically
// be added if necessary. Note that it is *not* a complete top-level window!
// Thus, it can be embedded in other windows, and more than one can exist in a window.
// If you want a separate top-level sequence viewing window, then simply put this
// object into a wxFrame (with whatever menus you want to attach to it).

// A note on memory and processor efficiency: the SequenceViewerWidget does *not*
// keep an entire array of characters in memory, nor does it keep a canvas of the
// entire pixel image of the alignment in memory, thus it should be able to display
// large alignments without incurring NxN memory usage. However, this means that
// the display must be created dynamically, by calls to the ViewableAlignment's
// member functions, as appropriate. It only calls these functions on the
// minimum number of positions needed to fill out the display, including on
// scrolling operations: if you scroll the view one column to the right, only
// the rightmost column is redrawn, and thus the number of calls to GetCharacterAt()
// is equal only to the number of rows in the visible region. Hopefully this will
// provide a reasonable compromise between memory and CPU efficiency.
