// This is the generic interface to a viewable alignment; it provides a minimal
// set of functions that are required to build the display. Any objects to be
// displayed in the SequenceViewerWidget must be derived from ViewableAlignment,
// and must implement these functions.

    // should set the overall size of the display, in columns (width) and rows (height)
    virtual void GetSize(int *columns, int *rows) const = 0;

    // should set the character and its traits to display at the given location;
    // both columns and rows are numbered from zero. If the return value is false,
    // the cell for this character will be left blank. If 'isHighlighted' is set
    // to true, the character will be drawn with the character color against
    // a highlight-color background.
    virtual bool GetCharacterTraitsAt(int column, int row,      // location
        char *character,                                        // character to draw
        wxColour *color,                                        // color of this character

    ///// the following funtions are optional; they do nothing as-is, but can  /////
    ///// be overridden to provide some user-defined behaviour on these events /////

    // this is called when the mouse is moved over a cell; (-1,-1) means
    // the mouse is not over the character grid. This is only called called once
    // when the mouse enters a cell, or leaves the grid - it is not repeated if
    // the mouse is dragged around inside a single cell.
    virtual void MouseOver(int column, int row) const { }

    // these are used in the the following feedback functions to tell whether
    // control keys were down at the time of (the beginning of) selection. The
    // 'controls' item may be any bitwise combination of the following:
    enum eControlKeys {
        eShiftDown      = 0x01,
        eControlDown    = 0x02,
        eAltOrMetaDown  = 0x04
    };

    // this is called when the mouse-down event occurs (i.e., at the
    // beginning of selection), saying where the mouse was at the time and
    // with what control keys (see eControlKeys above)
    virtual void MouseDown(int column, int row, unsigned int controls) const { }

    // this is the callback when the the widget is in eSelect mode; it gives the
    // corners of the rectangle of cells selected.
    virtual void SelectedRectangle(
        int columnLeft, int rowTop, 
        int columnRight, int rowBottom) const { }

    // this is the callback when the widget is in eDrag mode; it gives two cells,
    // one where the mouse button-down occurred, and one where mouse-up occurred.
    virtual void DraggedCell(

// This is the GUI class itself. It is a wxScrolledWindow - a viewing area where
// characters are drawn, with right and bottom scrollbars that will automatically
// be added if necessary. Note that it is *not* a complete top-level window!
// If you want a separate sequence viewing window, then simply put this object
// into a wxFrame (with whatever menus you want to attach to it).

// A note on memory and processor efficiency: the SequenceViewerWidget does *not*
// keep an entire array of characters in memory, nor does it keep a canvas of the
// entire pixel image of the alignment in memory, thus it should be able to display
// large alignments without incurring NxN memory usage. However, this means that
// the display must be created dynamically, by calls to the ViewableAlignment's
// member functions, as appropriate. It only calls these functions on the
// minimum number of positions needed to fill out the display, including on
// scrolling operations: if you scroll the view one column to the right, only
// the rightmost column is redrawn, and thus the number of calls to GetCharacterAt()
// is equal only to the number of rows in the visible region. Hopefully this will
// provide a reasonable compromise between memory and CPU efficiency.

    // upon button-up. If eDrag, two individual cells are rubberbanded: one where
    // the mouse was upon button-down, and one where the mouse is while
    // being dragged; DraggedCell() will be called upon button-up. In any case,
