Manual testing of the DB connectivity
-------------------------------------


./test_netstorage_rpc -> ./netstoraged -> ./netcat -> MSSQL


1. Detect the MS SQL address via executing in MS SQL Server Studio:
   select @@SERVERNAME
   and then, e.g.
   $ host mssql113

2. Have GNU netcat e.g. 0.7.1 at hand to create a proxy:
   $ ./netcat -L mssql113.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:1433 -p 1433

   Attention: port 1433 is vitally important. Simple DB API will not work if
   the port number is anything but 1433

   Presence or absence of a DB connection is imitated via running/killing netcat

3. netstoraged.ini must have a service pointing to netcat, e.g.

   [database]
   service=localhost:1433
   user_name=netstorage_write
   password=allowed_write
   database=NETSTORAGE

4. netstoraged.ini must have an api_key for filetrack, e.g.

   [netstorage_api]
   netcache=netcache_api
   filetrack=filetrack
   [filetrack]
   api_key=bqyMqDEHsQ3foORxBO87FMNhXjv9LxuzF9Rbs4HLuiaf2pHOku7D9jDRxxyiCtp2

5. netstoraged.ini must have a service configured for test_netstorage_rpc the
   way it uses for connecting, e.g.

   [metadata_conf]
   service_name_01=iebdev11.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:9822

6. netstoraged.ini server port must match the one from the metadata config
   service, e.g.

   [server]
   port=9822

7. test_netstorage_rpc should be manually tweaked to have a direct connection
   to the server:

   connect/services/test/test_netstorage_rpc.cpp:

   #define NETSTORAGE_SERVICE_NAME "iebdev11.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:9822"


Checking that the things are going as expected could be done via looking at
- top -> to control the threads
- MS SQL Server Studio -> to control records in the DB
- tail -f netstoraged.log -> to control incoming commands
