 * File Description:
 *     Accession naming patterns are derived from the input accessions
 *     by locating all groups of consecutive digits, and either
 *     replacing these with numerical ranges, or keeping them as is
 *     if this group has the same value for all input accessions.
 *     We also count the number of accesion for each pattern.
 *
 *     Sample input : AC123.1 AC456.1 AC789.1 NC8967.4 NC8967.5
 *                      ^^^ ^                   ^^^^ ^
 *     Sample output: AC[123..789].1 3  NC8967.[4,5] 2
