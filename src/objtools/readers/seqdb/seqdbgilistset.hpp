    /// Constructor
    ///
    /// This class encapsulates some of the behavior of the GI lists
    /// owned by the SeqDB object.  First, GI lists read from files
    /// will be shared by any number of volumes.  Secondly, the
    /// constructor takes a user GI list, which has a special effect
    /// when translating GIs.  If it is not specified, all alias node
    /// GI lists will be completely translated via the ISAM indices.
    /// If it is specified, then alias node GI lists will only be
    /// translated from the user GI list, so that only those GIs
    /// mentioned in the user GI list will be available (but the
    /// translation should be faster).
    ///
    /// @param atlas
    ///   The memory management layer object.
    /// @param vol_set
    ///   The set of database volumes.

    /// This returns a reference to an object containing the GI list
    /// read from the specified filename.  A cache is kept so that
    /// each GI list file is only read once.  OIDs for the file are
    /// translated after reading.  If the user gi list was specified,
    /// it will be used to translate GIs on this list the first time
    /// (and only the first time) this method is called for each gi
    /// list.  If the user GI list is not available, the ISAM database
    /// will be consulted to translate this GI list on every call to
    /// this method.  This is necessary because each volume can supply
    /// only part of the translation for this GI list.  Therefore, for
    /// performance reasons, this method should not be called more
    /// than once for the same volume/GI list combination.
