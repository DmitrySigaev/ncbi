----- Background -----
It is sometimes convenient to have mask info stored and retrieved 
based on sequence's GI number.   The advantage is that, unlike OID 
which may change over the time during DB updates, GI is more stable.
Another usage is to have volume independent mask info stored along
with alias database, so that different mask algos created on the same
set of volume DB files do not interfere.

To retrieve the mask info, GI must first be looked up for the sequence.  
The Gi lookup file is designed to help with this process; another
fall back option is to parse the ASN1 header file for GI, which is an
expensive process.

----- Gi Lookup File Format -----
Encoding: binary
Style:    fixed size data

  Using column data file to store OID->GI lookup data is possible, 
  however, it is not efficient since GIs are fixed in length and 
  we do not need a separate index file to record the offsets to the 
  data file.  

  Instead, we use a separate file format for OID->GI lookup.  The file 
  format could be potentially useful for any OID->X mapping so long 
  as X is fixed in size. (Non-fix-sized data are already supported by 
  the column data format). 

(All offsets are in bytes.)
