* File Description:
*   Hit subject mixer class definition.
*
*   The purpose of this class is to map different subjects within a same query
*   to non-overlapping regions of sequence so that they could be processed
*   uniformely by group identification algorithms. And vice versa, given hits
*   and mapping information, restore original subject names.
