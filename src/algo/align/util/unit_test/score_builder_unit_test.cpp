* File Description:
*   Unit tests for the CScoreBuilder class.
*
* NOTE:
*   Boost.Test reports some memory leaks when compiled in MSVC even for this
*   simple code. Maybe it's related to some toolkit static variables.
*   To avoid annoying messages about memory leaks run this program with
*   parameter --detect_memory_leak=0

// then test_boost.hpp will define such "main()" function for tests.

// Usually if your unit tests contain only one *.cpp file you should not
