This directory contains the implementation of the core of the BLAST algorithm
(also known as the BLAST engine). In the future, NCBI may provide a simple
C API to access this implementation, in the meantime, working with these
sources directly is possible, but not recommended unless one is very familiar
with them.

Build instructions
------------------
To build these source files into a library without the rest of the NCBI C++
toolkit, one should use the following commands (on UNIX):

./configure --with-projects=scripts/projects/blast_core_lib.lst \
            --without-debug --with-mt --with-build-root=ReleaseMT
cd c++/ReleaseMT/build
make all_p

This will configure and build an optimized library called blast, which can then
be referenced in makefiles as follows:

NCBI_HOME=<installation directory of the NCBI C++ toolkit>
-I$NCBI_HOME/c++/ReleaseMT/inc -I$NCBI_HOME/c++/include
-L $NCBI_HOME/c++/ReleaseMT/lib

NOTE: By following this approach some features supported by the NCBI C++ toolkit
such as BLAST database access, BLAST formatting, embedded logging, MT locking,
and configuration support will be absent or only partially supported.
