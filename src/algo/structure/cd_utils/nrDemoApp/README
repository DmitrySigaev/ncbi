Input for the non-redundifier demo (all filenames assumed in same dir as executable):

-tax:  filename:  contains a list of taxonomy IDs

-asn:  filename:  contains an ascii Cdd-pref-nodes blob with either preferred-nodes or model-organisms set

-dm :  filename:  pairwise distance values, indexed by entry in -tax.
                  First value is integral dimension of array; should be identical
                  to number of ids in -tax.  After that, arranged in list of doubles 
                  as (0,0), (0, 1), ... (0, dim-1), (1,1), ......, (dim-1, dim-1).
                  I.e., upper triangular portion of a symmetric dist matrix, plus
                  the diagonal elements.

-t:    on same scale as values in -dm, a threshold for performing clustering.


Sample files:

Used cd01659 from my test CD thioredoxin_17.pcd, on my PC in test CDs/nr folder.
The tax ids file is "cd01659_taxIds.txt", the Cdd-pref-nodes blob has the
default name "taxNodes.asn".  There are three distance matrices:  
"cd01659_percId.mtx"
"cd01659_optExt.mtx"
"cd01659_blastAligned.mtx"
