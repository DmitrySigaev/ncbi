A. Thiessen and Stephen H. Bryant (2006) Nucl. Acids Res., 34, 2598-2606.  This
software is in the public domain, as per the notice at the end of this file.  

Currently the program supports files the in format of Cn3D and the Conserved
Domain Database (CD format).  A preliminary version of an MFASTA -> CD converter
('fasta2cd') is also provided.

The Linux binary names end in '_LX' and PC binary names end in '.exe'; a Mac

=============================
1)  Overview:

The 'bma_refiner' program aims to refine an existing multiple alignment by using
the predetermined 'block model' of that domain family as a biologically relevant
constraint on the search space. A block model represents conserved
sequence/structure regions which are highly unlikely to contain gaps and are
common to all family members. The algorithm employed (sketched below) does well
in finding and fixing misalignments, even in families that contain
evolutionarily distant members, while not disrupting known regions of structural
and sequence conservation.   

Nevertheless, we do expect to start from a passably good initial multiple
alignment.  One that is contaminated by sequences unrelated to the domain family
being described, consists of multiple families with sufficiently distinctive
features or has other serious errors may be improved to some degree.  But the
initial flaws will confound the algorithm to various extents as it assumes all
sequences in the alignment do in fact belong to one family, so some global
misalignments may remain in such a case.   

The refinement protocol works by random selection and realignment of a sequence
with the family block model until no improvement in the alignment score has been
observed, or until the iteration cycle has expired. In the first phase of a
cycle of realignment, a dynamic programming algorithm is used on individual
sequences to realign the individual blocks.  (A block is defined as a region of
contiguous aligned gapless columns.)  This essentially shifts each block
attempting to correct misalignments between a given sequence and the rest of the
profile and at the same time preserves the family's overall block model (i.e.,
the conserved core regions).  The latter constraint prohibits the insertion of
gap characters in the middle of conserved blocks.  In a second phase of a
refinement cycle, the blocks in the alignment are allowed to be extended or
shortened in size depending on the overall score improvement. (The phase does
not use a dynamic programming approach.)   
 
The algorithm has been benchmarked against many Conserved Domain Database (CDD)
alignments and shows an overall score improvement, reliability in retrieval of
functional important sites and enhanced sensitivity compared to the original CDD
alignment. The method is also reasonably fast and can realign several hundreds
of highly diverse sequences within minutes.  The refinement method also provides
a means to detect the outlier sequences within an alignment and may thereby
point a way towards new subfamily identification schemes. 


=============================
2)  Input & Output formats:

The native format for alignments is the same as that used by CDD
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) and the 3D structure
viewer/alignment editor Cn3D
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.shtml).  Namely, the
bma_refiner takes so-called CD files with a default file extension '.cn3'. [Formerly called 'acd' files, only the default file extension has been changed and the data in the files remains unchanged.  The bma_refiner program does not require any particular file extension for the input alignment file.].  

Such CD files can be saved from Cn3D directly or acquired via the CDD service.  These files contain the alignment formatted according the NCBI data specification in ASN.1.  See the NCBI & CDD web sites for details.   

To support user-created alignments a utility, 'fa2cd' [formerly named 'fasta2cd'], to convert FASTA-formatted multiple alignments to a CD file is available.  See section (4) below for more details, or the web site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdtree/fa2cd.shtml.  


NOTE:  A 'data' subdirectory contains some basic information used in
constructing the family profiles.  This directory should be placed in the same
directory in which you install the binary. 

=============================
3)  Command options:

A full list of command options is available by using the flag -h (for a brief
summary) or -help (list with descriptions):  e.g,  ./bma_refiner -help 


There is one mandatory argument, -i, the initial alignment in CD file format.  

Other simple options include:

-o               (specifies the base file name for refined alignments)
-selection_order (how to choose order sequences are refined) 
-lno             (recompute PSSM after this many sequences refined; default = 1)
-nc              (number of cycles per trial; 3-5 is a typical value)

-be_noShrink     (do not allow blocks to shrink in size)
-be_fix          (do not modify block boundaries; i.e., skip the second phase of refinement)
-no_LOO          (only modify block boundaries; i.e., skip the first phase of refinement)
-ex              (extension of input alignment fragment; see below)

-q               (minimal information printed during refinement)
-n               (number of independent trials; each uses a different order of rows 
                  in the first refinement phase for random selection_order; no affect otherwise)
-nout            (of the 'n' trials, save the best 'nout' of them; default = 1)
-details         (redirect program log to the specified file)


-selection_order 1:  this is the default value that refines sequences in worst-to-best order, as measured by the score of the sequence against the original PSSM.  You can choose a random order by specifying selection_order 0.  In this case, the -n and -nout options are enabled as the order is no longer deterministic and you may therefore request multiple trials.

-lno > 1:  the majority of time in bma_refiner is spent in re-computing the PSSM after each individual sequence is realigned.  To make the program finish more quickly, provide the option "-lno X", where X is an integer.  This requests an approximate refinement that recomputes the PSSM after every X-th sequence.  However, if X is too large the benefits of refinement are rapidly lost.  Therefore, in practice make X < 20% of the total number of rows in your alignment.

-ex:  this option directs the refiner to expand its search outside of the original start/stop range, considering up to the specified number of residues beyond the first and last aligned residues.  This assumes that the sequences to be refined are not aligned over their full length; when this assumption holds, -ex 20 has typically worked well.

<More details about remaining options to come ....>



=============================
4)  fa2cd:  A FASTA -> CD file conversion utility:

This program will produce a blocked alignment that by default has all aligned columns in the FASTA alignment.  The refinement algorithm's extension phase alone will not have any
effect in this case as every block is optimally extended, unless the first
block-shifting phase of refinement has made changes to the alignment.  Run the
converter as: 

fa2cd -i <input fasta file> 

The '-parseIds' flag will try and interpret the description line for each sequence in terms of recognized sequence accession formats.  The '-ibm' flag creates a CD whose alignment is the subset of columns from the input multiple alignment that contain no gap characters.

An optional -t <value> argument instructs the converter to trim 'bad' columns
from the output alignment.  Here, <value> is the minumum median PSSM score of a
column in the output alignment (3 is often a good choice).

(Use the -h or -help flags to see all available options.)

A few notes on FASTA file format:

a)  In general, input FASTA files are expected to follow the standard protein FASTA file format (for example, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/fasta.shtml).  Further, it is important that each sequence input has a unique identifier to avoid downstream errors.  By default, fa2cd assigns each sequence an integer as its local accession.  With the '-parseIds' option you instruct fa2cd to use information in your file to build sequence identifiers.

b)  When using '-parseIds', the description line (i.e., those with a leading '>' character; we may also use the term 'defline') is parsed by fa2cd, generating a sequence identifier based on the characters in the defline up to the first whitespace.  Therefore, to ensure unique identifiers make sure multiple definition lines do not start with the identical same word.  
For example, if two sequences have deflines ">ABC 1" and ">ABC 2", they will be assigned the same identifier when -parseIds is used.   

c)  Try and avoid using small integers as your defline (e.g., ">1"), unless you've done this for all deflines without repeating a number.  When using '-parseIds', unparseable identifiers may inadvertently duplicate a number you have already used.  Future versions of fa2cd will fix such conflicts. 



[Information about fa2cd is also available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdtree/cdtree.shtml.  fa2cd is also distributed as part of the CDTree software, a GUI-based application to aid in the classification of protein sequences and investigate their evolutionary relationships.  See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdtree/cdtree.shtml to learn more about CDTree.]


=============================
5)  Examples:

Sample data is available in the 'examples' subdirectory.  Example command line parameters are:

This performs one refinement trial with a maximum of 5 cycles using a particular
method for  scoring potential block extension/contraction events.  Each cycle
performs both refinement phases: 

./bma_refiner -i <input filename> -o <output basename> -p 1.0 -ex 20 -nc 5 -be_score 3.3.3  

This performs three refinement trials, each with a maximum of 5 cycles, but
skips the second refinement phase in every cycle.  The best two alignments from
among the three trials are saved to a file: 

./bma_refiner -i <input filename> -o <output basename> -p 1.0 -ex 20 -n 3 -nc 5 -nout 2 -be_fix


NOTE:  We have found that to obtain a good refinement, loop lengths between
blocks cannot be allowed to grow without bound.  To that end, using the
parameters -p 1.0 -ex 20 has provided a good compromise between rendering enough
of 'alignment space' accessible our algorithm while avoiding unrealistically
long loops being generated.
