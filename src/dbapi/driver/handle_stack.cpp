 * Revision 1.2  2001/09/27 16:46:32  vakatov
 * Non-const (was const) exception object to pass to the user handler
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2001/09/21 23:39:59  vakatov
 * -----  Initial (draft) revision.  -----
 * This is a major revamp (by Denis Vakatov, with help from Vladimir Soussov)
 * of the DBAPI "driver" libs originally written by Vladimir Soussov.
 * The revamp involved massive code shuffling and grooming, numerous local
 * API redesigns, adding comments and incorporating DBAPI to the C++ Toolkit.
