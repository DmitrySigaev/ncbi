Stress test has been taken from the BM library with minor tuning to build
under the Toolkit. Gives many compilation warnings (we can live with that).
Running stress test takes extremely long time, so it should not be part
of the routine overnight testing process but rather a one-time run 
when migrating to a new platform or library version.
