/*

* $Log$
* Revision 1.4  2004/06/02 17:50:49  ucko
* CPoolOfThreads: change type of m_Delta and m_ThreadCount to
* CAtomicCounter to reduce need for m_Mutex.
* KillAllThreads: make poison a CRef in the first place to make certain
* it doesn't get GCed prematurely.
* Move CVS log to end.
*
* Revision 1.3  2004/05/17 21:06:02  gorelenk
* Added include of PCH ncbi_pch.hpp
*
* Revision 1.2  2002/11/04 21:29:22  grichenk
* Fixed usage of const CRef<> and CRef<> constructor
*
* Revision 1.1  2001/12/11 19:54:45  ucko
* Introduce thread pools.
