 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.2  2005/01/11 18:32:49  dicuccio
 * MAGIC: disable dump of all leaked objects (speeds application exit by orders of
 * magnitude)
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/05/07 15:46:23  dicuccio
 * Copied over from compilers/msvc_prj
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/08/25 14:18:01  dicuccio
 * Added nested #ifdef to remove the default console in _DEBUG mode if
 * _DEBUG_NO_CONSOLE is #defined
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/08/21 12:34:06  dicuccio
 * Added additional gui projects
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/04/24 13:39:53  dicuccio
 * COnditionally include <crtdbg.h> if _DEBUG is defined
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/01/09 21:01:30  dicuccio
 * Moved WinMain into its own .cpp file.  Added winmain.cpp to build
